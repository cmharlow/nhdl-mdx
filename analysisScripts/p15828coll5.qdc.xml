<dc:description>CONNING     TOWER     GLEANINGS
Vol.    1,    No.    1  Plymouth, New Hampshire
WE ARE HAVING A BIRTHDAY
This year Plymouth Teachers College is celebrating its eightieth birthday.    While we are not
planning an elaborate birthday party, we should like to mark the occasion by honoring some of
the graduates of the early days of Plymouth Normal School to whom we owe so much of our
success.    V/e hope that a good many of the fifty living graduates of the classes of 19J1 and preceding ones will be at the reunion luncheon.
OUR CAMPUS IS GROV ING
Our campus has changed considerably since the days of the Parsonage and Peppard House.
Both of those buildings have been torn down; the former was replaced with lawn and the latter
with the bridge of Hall Dormitory.    The old Colley House, with the chicken yard gone, is now
our attractive Administration Building.    This last yea-r the third floor of Mary Lyon Hall was
remodelled and 34 modern rooms were added.   You will be interested in seeing   these new rooms.
OUR PROGRAM IS GROWING, TOO
We now have four curricula:   elementary, secondary in certain fields, early childhood, and
business education.    The early childhood program prepares teachers for nursery school and first
and second grades.    This is the only such curriculum offered north of Boston at the present time.
To help meet the teacher shortage, we are offering a conversion program which enables liberal
arts graduates and secondary teachers to qualify for elementary positions.    This year we expect to
award our first Master of Education degrees.   Making graduate work available^ to teachers is
another evidence that your college is keeping up to date and is trying to meet educational needs.
SOME FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE LEFT US
You may be interested in hearing about some of your favorite teachers who are no longer at
Plymouth.   Mr. Stevenson has retired.   He lives in Plymouth and does some painting.   Mr. Potlaid
lives in Plymouth and is very active in the community.    He is judge, secretary of the water
department, and preacher.    Mrs. Furlong is living in Georgia.    Mjss Farrell is now married and
is living in New York state.   Miss McLane is living in Williamstown, Massachusetts.   We hope
that some of your former teachers will be here on May 12.
THE ORGAN FUND NEEDS HELP
A fund has been started to purchase an electric organ, which will be dedicated to Dr. Silver.
This organ will be one that can be used in Livermore Hall and transferred to our new auditorium
when we get it.
REUNION DATE IS CHANGED
Some of you felt that commencement time was not a good time for reunion.   We want to
make it as convenient as possible for you to come to the reunion.   After all, that is your day.
This year we are planning to have our annual get-together on Saturday, May 12.    Our alumni
luncheon will be separate from the students' so that we may visit to our hearts' content.   The
afternoon program will be in the form of a memory time.    It will do you good to relive some of
the activities of your school days at Plymouth,   You will have a chance to hear our choir,  too,
and that in  itself is worth coming for.    In the evening the Social Club will present the Spring
Formal.    Members of the Alumni are invited to be guests.    Dormitory accommodations will be
available for botr. Friday and Saturday.   You are cordially invited to be a guest of the College on
either or both of these nights.   Please let us know in advance if you plan to stay overnight.</dc:description>

Early issues contain a separately-numbered insert titled Alumni Green; starting with volume 17, Alumni Green is integrated into the regular pagination.</dc:description>

name Better Education Through Technology (BETE). As of April, seven New I Iampshire schools and one in

The Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies at
Plymouth State is a post master's program, sponsored by
PSC and the New Hampshire State Department of
Education, designed for persons interested in pursuing
advanced academic work in educational change and
leadership.
Now in its second year at PSC, the CAGS program
graduated its first lour students in May,(Gail Carr and
Stephen Lambert, PSC's coordinator of continuing education
and director of career development, respectively; Kathleen
Norris and Barbara Cohen), established a doctoral program
option in collaboration with the University of Sarasota, and
garnered rave reviews from its participants, all of whom are
mid-career professionals with full-time jobs in education or
human service-related fields.
What makes Plymouth's program unique, besides its
strong focus on leadership and its exchange with Sarasota,
is its implementation of cohort groups, small groups that
take classes together, similar to a college class.
&quot;The nature of PSC's CAGS program, built around a
cohort group, made it special for me,&quot; says Kathleen Norris,
director of guidance at Plymouth Regional High School, a
CAGS graduate currently pursuing her doctorate through

With Lindbergh's help,
Hatab self-designed a degree program that he describes as a forerunner of
the Integrated Arts option adopted at PSC in 1996.
&quot;In elementary school we need connectivity.&quot;  Hatab explains. &quot;We need
to integrate and blend things. We use music, dance, drama, painting — the
whether Johnny can draw. There's plenty of room in the curriculum for
movement and dance and music...not just the visual arts.&quot;
Hatab has received a grant for an arts in education development project
to design a Higher Order Thinking (HOT) program at Beaver Meadow in
Concord. Gilford, where he taught for 1 t years, has a similar program. HOT
Schools are arts-infused, arts-enriched schools that use learning in, about,
and through the arts as a key pathway to developing higher order thinking
&quot;It's a model for how we want our kids to learn,'' according to Hatab.
&quot;We want them to learn to think and to solve problems. We want them to
know how to take in information, synthesize it, and churn it out in a
completed form. This is just what the artist does.&quot;

LAST AUGUST 21ST, I ANNOUNCED THAT I WILL STEP DOWN as president at the end of June, allowing the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees time to conduct a national search for my successor. Within minutes of the mid-morning announcement, a cooper’s hawk perched on my car, attracting a crowd, including photographers. Then the hawk flew to the extension outside my third-floor window, where it stood quietly through the afternoon, again drawing attention. However people interpreted that hawk, whether as coincidence or metaphor, its presence marked the moment in a surprisingly moving way. Leadership is not a solo, but an ensemble performance in which people work together. I am proud of what the people of the Plymouth State community have achieved over the past nearly nine years. Innovative world-class faculty members have developed strong academic programs that are focused on our mission and responsive to needs of students, employers, and the state in fields from environmental science and professional sales leadership to nursing, heritage studies, tourism, and more. Technology has changed the way faculty members teach, expanding opportunities for creativity. Undergraduate and graduate programs are available online, increasing access for students. PSU enjoys a thriving Doctor of Education program, with 75 impressive candidates now preparing to serve New Hampshire and New England. A much-needed Doctor of Physical Therapy program soon will be launched. Plymouth State’s regional impact has extended through outstanding work by the Centers for the Environment, for Rural Partnerships, and for Active Living and Healthy Communities. These centers promote healthy places, healthy economies, and healthy people through increased faculty and student research. Award-winning programs in the arts and humanities enhance PSU’s cultural outreach. And PSU students in majors across the campus increasingly participate in hands-on, minds-on experiential learning, doing real-world projects that increase the depth of their education, set-ting them apart when they seek professional positions, and at the same time serving our important partners—businesses, government, schools, and nonprofits. PSU’s Enterprise Center at Plymouth, a small-business incubator and accelerator in partnership with the Grafton County Economic Development Council, creates opportunities for students and new jobs for the area. The Museum of the White Mountains, promoting the region’s history and culture, attracts thousands of visitors and offers PSU additional resources for critical thinking and academic engagement. Plymouth State’s international presence has extended, with dozens of partnerships, an office in China, and a campus Center for Global Engagement to help all students strengthen their global understanding. I was pleased to be recognized by New Hampshire Magazine as one of its seven Women of the World because of PSU’s heightened international profile. Similarly, PSU has been recognized as one of the nation’s most environmentally responsible institutions of higher education, an achievement due, again, to many people’s contributions. PSU’s living and learning environment has evolved in ways consistent with sustainability and with twenty-first-century living and learning needs. Mary Lyon Residence Hall has been remodeled for sustainability and historic preservation, and it, Langdon Woods Residential Complex, and the Savage Welcome Center and Hanaway Rink have won awards for sustainable design. The campus acquired Highland Hall and developed PSU-Concord to meet the needs of the growing graduate learning community. Samuel Read Hall Building is being remodeled for additional STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programs and the Hartman Union Building for expanded technology and dining. This year will be an exciting one, with ALLWell North, a wonderful building for PSU’s future, under construction, and a new strategic plan, Focus 2020, now being implemented. Both initiatives will enhance student success. I want to complete the Imagine A Way fund-raising campaign that, to date, has raised $18,300,000 to support students and the campus, with a goal of $20,000,000 by the year’s end. I hope that you will join me in achieving that goal. At Plymouth State, people concentrate on student success. Like the hawk with which I opened this introduction, PSU will continue this year and beyond to emphasize what matters, look to the horizon, and soar. Sara Jayne Steen, President Leadership is not a solo, but an ensemble performance in which people work together.
Foreign policy expert Joseph S. Nye Jr., received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters at Plymouth State’s fall Convocation. Bruce Lyndes photo. Plymouth State University  plymouth.edu/magazine 3 of note PSU Awards Honorary Degree to Foreign Policy Expert Joseph Nye Jr. Joseph S. Nye Jr., one of the nation’s foremost leaders in international relations, received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters, presented by PSU President Sara Jayne Steen at fall Convocation, which marks the start of a new academic year. Nye served as dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and with the Department of Defense, the National Intelligence Council, and the State Department. In 2005 he was voted one of the 10 most influential scholars of international relations in the US, and in 2011 he was named one of the world’s most important global thinkers. He told students they all have the capacity to become leaders. “Take the next four years at PSU … set yourself a goal, and that’s to spend the next four years in teaching yourself leadership and I tell you that you will succeed,” said Nye. PSU’s class of 2018 is comprised of approximately 800 entering students who were chosen from nearly 4,800 applicants. The class includes students from 20 states and 8 countries. PSU Earns FIRE’s Highest Rating for Free Speech Demonstrating its commitment to protecting free speech on campus, Plymouth State University recently reformed its speech codes, and in the process has garnered a green light rating from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), the organization’s highest award. “PSU is to be commended for its commitment to free speech,” said FIRE President Greg Lukianoff. “As one of only 20 schools to earn a green light rating from FIRE, Plymouth State is now a leader in protecting the freedom of speech on campus.” FIRE began working on speech code reform with PSU faculty and administrators in January 2014. Sam Brickley, a professor of business law at PSU, led the effort at the University along with a group of PSU administrators and faculty. FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders, scholars, journalists, and public intellectuals from across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights, freedom of expression, academic freedom, due process, and rights of conscience in US colleges and universities. Sierra Club Names Plymouth State One of America’s Greenest Schools The Sierra Club has named PSU to its list of America’s Greenest Schools, a ranking based on an extensive questionnaire that assesses a wide range of criteria, such as the institution’s energy sources and on-campus landscape use of native plants. “At PSU, we say that green is more than our school color and, to that end, we have made efforts to integrate sustainability not just in academic classes, but across our operations and thinking,” said Brian Eisenhower, PSU’s director of environmental sustainability. “One reason the Sierra Club’s Greenest Schools ranking is so meaningful is the comprehensive nature of their analyses, which involves a great deal of information about campus operations, curricular efforts, and co-curricular activities,” Eisenhower added. PSU students are involved with numerous environmental awareness and advocacy activities, including reducing the use of plastic water bottles on campus. Studies reveal 86 percent of water bottles sold in the US are not recycled, and are either incinerated or end up in landfills. PSU Students Earn High National Ranking in Critical Thinking and Problem Solving The Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA), a standardized test, revealed that Plymouth State University seniors rank in the 95th percentile for “value added” knowledge, or knowledge and skills acquired during undergraduate years, suggesting major gains in critical thinking and problem-solving skills during the four academic years. The CLA measures critical thinking, analytical reasoning, problem solving, and written communication skills, and requires thoughtful, open-ended written responses. “Regional and national employers are asking for graduates with this twenty-first century skill set,” said David Zehr, PSU’s associate vice president for undergraduate studies. “Based on these test results, our faculty can take great pride in the work they do with our students,” Zehr added. 4 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 PSU PUBLICATIONS Health Care Policy and Practice: A Biopsychosocial Perspective, (fourth edition) Cynthia Moniz, professor of social work and Stephen Gorin, professor of social work In this fourth edition of their social work textbook, Cynthia Moniz and Stephen Gorin have restructured the book to guide students through the development of the American health care system: what it is, what the policies are, and how students can influence them. The authors have also updated their text to incorporate health care reform. Redesigning Courses for Online Delivery: Design, Interaction, Media &amp; Evaluation, Robyn Parker, professor of organizational communication and organizational behavior This volume examines key considerations for effective online course redesign. Using a four-phase approach, Redesigning Courses for Online Delivery informs thinking, inspires creativity, and structures decisions to drive the development of high-quality online learning experiences. Both scholarly and practical, it provides a comprehensive approach to redesign useful to novices and veterans alike. Healthy Children, Healthy Minds: Helping Children Succeed NOW for a Brighter Future, Marcel Lebrun, professor of curriculum and instruction, education, and special education; and Kimberly Williams, education teaching lecturer The latest collaboration between Marcel Lebrun and Kimberly Williams (Keeping Kids Safe, Healthy, and Smart) is an excellent resource for educators, parents, and anyone who is interested in and committed to fostering healthy patterns of behavior, thinking, and lifestyle choices in children. This book provides strategies on how to keep the brain and mind healthy, and how to address challenges to brain and mind health, such as mental illness and substance abuse. Transformative Leisure: A Philosophy of Communication, Annette M. Holba, professor of rhetoric Our impressions of leisure today often involve rest, relaxation, and freedom from work. These impressions are misguided if their limits remain unchallenged. This book reveals the deep essence of leisure by repositioning it as a philosophy of communication that cultivates the mind and body. Stay Alive Series #1–4, Joseph Monninger, professor of English PSU author Joseph Monninger has embarked on a fun new writing adventure. Stay Alive is a planned series of adventure books for upper elementary and middle school-aged readers. Each book features a disaster faced by a group of children who must find their own way to survival, from a plane crash in the remote Alaskan wilderness to a freak earthquake off the coast of Maine. Monninger’s characters are true-to-life, ranging from whiny to unexpectedly resourceful to dangerously inept. The first four books in the Stay Alive series are #1: Crash, #2: Cave-in, #3: Breakdown, and #4: Flood. The Legacy of Fort William Henry: Resurrecting the Past, David R. Starbuck, professor of anthropology Fort William Henry, America’s early frontier fort at the southern end of Lake George, NY, was a flashpoint for conflict between the British and French empires in America. Over the past decade, new and exciting archeological findings, in tandem with modern forensic methods, have changed our view of life at the fort prior to the massacre, by providing physical evidence of the role that Native Americans played on both sides of the conflict. Intertwining recent revelations with those of the past, Starbuck creates a lively narrative beginning with the earliest Native American settlement on Lake George. Electrified Skeletons, Paul Rogalus, professor of English From “Psychos on the Highway” to “Addicts,” Paul Rogalus writes about the bizarreness of everyday life with sardonic humor and gritty realism. This collection of microstories turns on themes of adventure and friendship, yet it never strokes the inauthentic device of happily-ever-afters. Taken by Storm 1938: A Social and Meteorological History of the Great New England Hurricane, Lourdes Aviles, professor of meteorology On September 21, 1938, one of the most powerful storms of the twentieth century came unannounced into the lives of New Yorkers and New Englanders, leaving utter devastation in its wake. The Great Hurricane, as it came to be known, changed every-thing, from the landscape and its inhabitants’ lives, to weather bureau practices, to the measure and kind of relief New Englanders would receive during the Great Depression and the resulting pace of regional economic recovery. Aviles’s compelling history successfully weaves science, historical accounts, and social analyses to create a comprehensive picture of this devastating hurricane. 2013-14 have been prolific years for Bruce Heald, history teaching lecturer, who published the following titles: A History of the Boston and Maine Railroad A History of Dog Sledding in New England A History of the New Hampshire Abenaki New Hampshire and the Revolutionary War Old Country Stores of New Hampshire One-Room Schoolhouses of New Hampshire: Primers, Penmanship and Potbelly Stoves United States Mail Boat: Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire Social work students traveled to the Dominican Republic in spring 2014 for a week-long service-learning trip in which they helped effect change in a small village through advocacy and community action. Plymouth State University ~ plymouth.edu/magazine 5 GOING GLOBAL A portrait of an increasingly international university where visiting faculty, exchange programs, and foreign-study trips are all part of educating students in the new world—and whose graduates are making a mark in the global economy. JIM COLLINS 6 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 When Deb Regan started at Plymouth State in 1998 with a charge to develop experiential learning and off-campus opportunities, there was no office on campus designated for international students or study abroad programs. Just eight students were doing anything at all in other countries, all of them in large part through their own persistence.”We went from eight folders being handed to us,” Regan says, “to 100 students who will spend a semester abroad this year and another 120 or so who will go on international faculty-led trips.” The growth is both intentional and symbolic. Now the director of PSU’s Global Education Office (GEO), Regan oversees an increasingly diverse, multicultural array of experiential and off-campus opportunities that contribute to the evolving definition of what it means to educate students in the twenty-first century. As the world’s economies—and challenges— become increasingly integrated and interdependent, as digital technology profoundly accelerates the exchange of products, services, and ideas, the University’s role of educating future leaders has become more global in nature as well. Those future leaders can tap into a network of PSU alumni whose professional portfolios already include substantial international elements. Many of those graduates— such as John Garnsey ’73, Hunt Ramsbottom ’79, Leesa Smith ’84, and Joe Teno ’85G—attended Plymouth State at a time when there was little global education on campus. But the quality of their business education prepared them for careers that would expand, in ways they could never have predicted, far beyond the borders of New England and the United States. Their wisdom and experience create an additional international resource for today’s students. The Entrepreneur Hunt Ramsbottom ’79 was typical in many ways of the students at Plymouth State College in the late 1970s. He came from Providence, RI, from a hard-working family that owned and ran a small printing com-pany. He studied business and played on the lacrosse team. He worked pumping gas and waiting tables in Waterville Valley. At that time, there wasn’t much international experience or exposure available to students at Plymouth State, formally or informally. In his business classes, Ramsbottom learned nuts-and-bolts economics and business strategy, without much regard for the world outside of the northeastern United States. “I had one professor, though--Hennessy-- whose brother was a CEO of a big conglomerate,” says Ramsbottom. “He was always talking about him. That really interested me.” Ramsbottom returned to Providence with a BS in Business Administration and worked in the family printing business, but couldn’t shake the idea of wanting a bigger platform. Sensing an opportunity in the printing of software documentation and technical materials, he moved to the West Coast and started a niche printing company of his own. He sold it before he was 30, for a profit, and discovered an affinity for risk and a taste for acquiring and selling companies. He led a leveraged buyout of a California-based chain of automotive paint stores, aggressively pursued mergers and acquisitions, and grew the multi-state business into the largest supplier of auto paint in North America before taking it public in 1995. Ten years later, by the time he became CEO and president of Rentech, a technology startup involved with developing alternative fuels, Ramsbottom had bought and sold nearly 70 small and medium-sized companies. When energy market conditions drastically changed, Ramsbottom sold off the Rentech technology to a Chinese company and pivoted the company into the supply and distribution of wood fiber, eventually operating 39 facilities in the US, Canada, Chile, and Uruguay, becoming a world leader. In spring 2014, Rentech announced the purchase of the country’s largest supplier of home-heating wood pellets, New England Wood Pellet, headquartered in Jaffrey, NH. The acquisition secured a deep supply for, among other things, long-term contracts with coal-fired power plants in the UK and Canada converting to biomass. It also brought the entrepreneur back home, in a sense—and expanded the kind of big-business platform he’d once dreamed about as a student at Plymouth State. ~ Copyright Devin Ford photo. “The idea of being involved in business at the global level was really exciting.” —Hunt Ramsbottom ’79 Players on the World Stage Plymouth State University ~ plymouth.edu/magazine 7 It’s beautiful here,” says Peng- Khuan Chong, a professor of political science who brings an international perspective to class every day. “But I tell my students they need to get out of their comfort zones. I tell them that the University can give them skills and knowledge, but going somewhere else tests those skills and knowledge. That experience develops competence, confidence, and compassion. My students call them ‘Chong’s Cs.’” Chong, a part of the faculty for nearly 50 years, has played an active role in expanding Plymouth’s international footprint. In 2011 and 2012, he helped establish PSU student and faculty exchanges with Universiti Tenku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) in Kampar, Malaysia, and Sunway University in Kuala Lumpur. He is a board governor and visiting professor at Houdegbe North American University in Benin, West Africa. Leesa Smith ’84, an executive with the German-owned multinational corporation Freudenburg, confirms from the professional world what Chong tells his students on campus. “In order to win the game,” she says, “we’re going to need diverse management teams. We’re going to need people with cultural experience that you can’t get from only being in a classroom.” Smith, who regularly travels overseas for business, is one of a growing number of PSU graduates working on the international stage. “Students should absolutely take advantage of any opportunities they have to travel abroad,” she says. “To Plymouth State students, I would say: If you don’t have a passport—get one. If an opportunity comes up—jump on it.” THE LIAISON When she’s not traveling, Leesa Smith ’84 splits her professional time between offices in New Hampshire and Michigan, overseeing North American operations in the US, Canada, and Mexico for a multinational corporation headquartered in Germany. She is the archetypal twenty-first-century global executive. Smith received an accounting degree from Plymouth State in 1984, then an executive MBA degree from the UNH Whittemore School of Business. She’ll never forget a demanding accounting professor who expected more from her than she thought she had in her. “The fact that he didn’t make it easy turned out to be a key experience for me,” she says. “For the first time in my life, I learned I could push.” A prime opportunity came when Freudenberg, a 140-year-old family-owned German corporation, created a North American subsidiary in New Hampshire called Freudenberg NOK, and hired Smith as its new treasury manager. She found herself in-state, learning on the job in a foreign environment—the engineering and manufacturing of automotive sealing and gaskets—within a diversified global corporation that produced, in particular, lubricants, sealants, vibration technology, surface coatings, and non-linen textiles for industries ranging from aerospace to medical to apparel to heavy construction. Nominally in charge of accounting, Smith recognized gaps in other areas and tried to address them. She had a mentor who pushed her toward the edge of the envelope without letting her get cut. She raised her hand for unpopular projects. (“Why was a treasury director the one to write the company’s policy on alcohol and drug abuse?” she asks.) She showed a talent for looking at the big picture. The home front noticed. After a promotion to director of finance, Smith created a shared accounting center in Michigan that coordinated treasury, insurance, and pension management across all of Freudenberg’s 15 business groups in North America, covering some 6,000 employees and 21 percent of the corporation’s annual $8 billion in sales. In 2011 Smith became the first woman ever appointed to the corporation’s global executive team, where she “interfaces with legal, tax, human resources, finance, and communications at the parent company board level.” She represents North America in quarterly strategic meetings in Germany alongside regional representatives from Latin America, China, India, and Southeast Asia. She recently needed additional pages put into her passport. “That feels a little like an honor to me,” she says. “It’s not about the degree. It’s about life experiences and opportunities.” —LEESA SMITH ’84 Tif Edward LLewellyn Ochal photo. 8 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 John Garnsey ’73, who oversees global mountain development for the world’s largest ski company, Vail Resorts, puts it this way: “English may be the universal language of business, but there are so many cultural perspectives and differences around the world that are subtle, even between the US and Western Europe. Being able to travel and work in different countries allows a much deeper understanding of where people come from. That understanding is crucial for both relationships and negotiations.” Among the foreign study programs that PSU offers, the most eye-opening might be the Freshman Abroad Program, an innovative model among American universities that allows accepted students to spend the first semester of their first year studying at the University of Limerick in Ireland. Each year, some 20 incoming Plymouth first-year students take advantage of the program and become first-year students at the University of Limerick. Half of them, typically, are New Hampshire residents with little or no prior travel experience. “It’s a powerful way for those students to start their college experience,” says Deb Regan, GEO director. “They come back to Plymouth State with self-confidence, self-awareness, and a greater appreciation for how big the world is. Their experience changes the campus back home, and makes it more diverse and worldly.” The timing of the program, coming at the start of a PSU education, also sends a powerful message, according to Regan: international perspective is important to us. Upper-class students have additional opportunities, ranging The Matchmaker “I was at Plymouth State in the Dark Ages,” says John Garnsey ’73. “There wasn’t much back then in the way of international exposure. But Plymouth allowed me to get a degree in business in a beautiful setting while I pursued my passion, which is skiing.” He started at the bottom of the hill, working as a ski patroller at Waterville Valley. He moved west a year after graduating to Vail, CO, where he joined Vail Mountain’s racing department and trails crew and found his life’s work. He steadily climbed through the ski area’s mountain operations, then became vice president of the fledgling Vail Valley Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to enhancing the valley’s athletic, cultural, and educational programming. He was instrumental in bringing the 1989 World Alpine Championships to the Vail Valley, a massive event drawing athletes from 80 countries and international media exposure reaching more than a billion spectators and fans of the sport. In the process, he began cultivating relationships across the skiing parts of the globe that would flourish throughout his career. From 1991 to 1999, Garnsey served as president of the foundation. He helped bring the world championships back to Vail/Beaver Creek a second time, then joined Vail Resorts as senior vice president and chief operating officer of Beaver Creek. In 2008, he was named president of the company’s global mountain development. As part of the premier ski company in North America, with 10 resorts in Colorado, California, and the northern Midwest, “it made sense to look at my position and my contacts,” Garnsey says, “and see what I could do to help the company grow internationally.” from semesters studying environmental science in Torino, Italy, to archaeological digs in Scotland, to shorter faculty-led trips in Africa and Asia. Students who are a part of PSU’s Model UN have attended world conferences in Mexico, Singapore, and Helsinki. Other undergrads have designed and planned service trips to the developing world, such as helping build a primary school in Nicaragua and implementing a sustainable water system in eastern Africa. Many students who go abroad come back and switch their majors or think differently about future careers: the course of their lives is changed by their international experience. The chance to work and live in foreign cultures, in many cases, fosters an openness to new experiences and an ease with confronting unfamiliar situations—intangible assets that employers value highly. Hunt Ramsbottom ’79, CEO of Rentech, a global supplier of wood fiber and wood pellets for heating, oversees manufacturing and supply-chain operations in the US, Canada, and South America. “We have a bunch of young, smart people in our company,” he says, “and not all of them are up for the challenge of living and working in a different country. But the ones who understand languages and cultures ... I value them especially. We can deploy them and let them run. I’d encourage students to learn languages and work abroad. Those graduates will be like gold to employers.” Plymouth State University ~ plymouth.edu/magazine 9 Currently, PSU has formal exchange arrangements with 10 partner institutions around the world, including the Dalarna University in Sweden, the Hong Kong Institute of Education, and the Universidad Austral de Chile. A broad variety of programs and opportunities is available through respected and vetted study-abroad providers, such as French-language immersion summers in Nova Scotia and the Semester at Sea program, a multiple-country study abroad program. All of them, fundamentally, aim at the same purpose. Provost Julie Bernier says the University—especially in this increasingly global world—has an obligation to expose students to rich cultural and educational experiences, both domestically and internationally. The University has thought creatively about how to make a wide range of those opportunities available. Ideally, Bernier says every single PSU student should have the chance to travel abroad. “Because of economics, though,” she says, “that’s not possible. Recognizing that reality, we try to bring the experience to them.” She points out the global studies academic requirement of all students, the faculty exchanges that bring international perspectives and expertise into classrooms, the international workshops, campus events, and student organizations. “We no longer live in a world where you interact only with people in your local community or your state,” she says. “It’s critical for our students to know how to interact and work with people from different backgrounds and cultures.” Jim Hundrieser ’90G, vice president for enrollment management and student affairs, reflects on the increasing diversity within the student body. “Twenty-five years ago, there might have been eight or ten international students on the entire campus,” he recalls, “and most of them were on the soccer team.” Today, between 70 and 100 international students are enrolled at PSU each semester. They come through exchange programs from Malaysia, Japan, Romania, Latin America; they come full-time from England, Sweden, Canada, and China. During the spring of 2014 alone, some 29 countries were represented among the student body. “Think of the richness those students add to the community,” Hundrieser says. Increasing the number of international students on campus is the University’s goal. In addition to the educational value to the community of learners, Hundrieser says there’s an untapped market of international students for whom Plymouth State would be a good fit. To help identify and recruit students from one especially promising part of that market, the University has recently opened an affiliate office in the Chinese city of Chengdu. The overall goal is ambitious: raise the number of international undergraduate and graduate students on campus to 430 by the year 2020. “Plymouth allowed me to get a degree in business in a beautiful setting while I pursued my passion, which is skiing.” ­— john garnsey ’73 John Garnsey ’73 (left) with Peter Schrocksnadel, president of the Austrian Ski Federation, following an aerial survey of ski resorts near Innsbruck, Austria. Garnsey has spent the past several years reconnecting with old acquaintances and making new ones in Western Europe, Central Europe, China, and Japan, looking for the right opportunities for acquisition and synergy. “We’re not the only ones looking internationally,” he says, “but we’re probably out in front.” He’s strategically involved with Vail’s international sales team, which works with agents and tourism companies to bring foreign skiers to the Vail Valley. (Among other programs, Vail has reciprocity agreements with resorts in Austria, France, China, and Japan, that encourage skiers to travel in both directions.) Garnsey says the travel and face-to-face experiences have given him a deeper understanding of the different cultures and helped with his ability to negotiate and to explain his company. “The ski industry is a small world,” he says. “Skiing is really a universal language with a lot of dialects. But the models are very different depending on where you are.” To pick just one example: American resorts tend to control the entire skier’s experience, from on-mountain to lodging, dining, and entertainment, while French resorts have very complicated overlapping partnerships and agreements to provide those services. Finding the right fits involves diligence and trust on both sides. Meanwhile, Garnsey has been inducted into the Colorado Ski and Snowboard Museum Hall of Fame and received the US Ski and Snowboard Association’s Julius Blegen Award for lifetime service to the sport. He successfully co-chaired a campaign to bring the World Alpine Championships back to the Vail Valley in 2015. In April this year, he announced he’ll retire from his full-time position following those international races, a fitting capstone to an ambassador’s career. ~ 10 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 It’s all part of the evolution of what it means to best serve a state, a region, and its students. From its founding in 1871 as Plymouth Normal School to becoming Plymouth Teachers College in 1939, to its development as Plymouth State College in 1963 and to Plymouth State University four decades later, the institution has changed in relation to the changing world around it. PSU has continually made its education relevant and made its students more employable and better prepared for the world they enter upon graduating. Higher education, at its best, pushes students beyond their personal boundaries: it offers avenues for exploration and self-discovery. In the end, it’s not the institution’s changes that define the education. It’s the change that happens in each and every student. And some things don’t change. Says Joe Teno ’85G, former L.L. Bean executive and founder of QOR, a new line of men’s active apparel, “I’d have to say that the fundamental elements of being a good person and a good business person are the same: trust, integrity, and treating people well. There are universal standards of behavior that transcend countries and nationalities. Being out in the world helps build that character.” ~ Jim Collins is a professional freelance writer living in New Hampshire and Seattle. The Retailer “I can’t give you a sound bite on Plymouth,” says Joe Teno ’85G. “Most of my classes were held off-site in Hanover. I had a full-time job as a master plumber and got my MBA at night. But I will say that the passion and energy of the instructors were phenomenal. They absolutely moved me onto a different path.” That path led to a finance position with L.L. Bean. The quantitative analysis Teno got through Plymouth State directly prepared him for that job, he recalls. “But I remember the interviewer saying, ‘You had a job and got your MBA at night?’ I think they recognized that there was a certain reality to my living situation—that I hadn’t been at school just for fun and games. That made an impression.” He stayed with L.L. Bean for 14 years before becoming vice president of operations and organizational development at TravelSmith. In 2001, he was hired away by a new women’s active apparel company, Athleta, where he served as senior vice president of operations and then president, the role he occupied when Gap purchased Athleta in 2008 for $150 million. If Teno had a feel for the international threads running through the American retail industry in those positions, he’s gotten full-on immersion in his latest venture: a start-up mail-order apparel company called QOR (pronounced “core”). The business, he says, will center on functional, high-quality fabric, well-crafted performance clothing designed for men who don’t want to be treated as stereotypes. He has spent much of the past year sourcing technical fiber in Switzerland and South and Central America, finding Merino wool producers in New Zealand and Australia, and cotton growers in Portugal. He has visited vendors in Canada, China, and Hong Kong; has attended trade shows in Munich and Berlin and in Florence, Italy. He’s toured shops in Europe, looking for ideas. “The top floor at Harrods in London is wonderfully inspiring,” he says. Teno wants the clothing and the presentation around it to be authentic, to celebrate qualities in men such as character, confidence, and vulnerability. The active part of his own résumé is authentic: Outward Bound in Maine at age 16, scores of White Mountain hikes above treeline, four years in the army including time with the Green Beret 10th Special Forces, six New York City Marathons, a climb of Mount Rainier, and a number of “century” bike rides. “Men who have known the joys of being active have also come to terms with their limitations,” he says. “When you reach that point in your life, it changes your relationship to other people and to the world.” At times, his travel schedule has been relentless and exhausting—and exhilarating. He says he has worked hard in his life, but never harder than he’s working right now. The first QOR catalogues hit mailboxes in October. ~ “There are universal standards of behavior that transcend countries and nationalities. ...

Plymouth State University ~ plymouth.edu/magazine 11 STUDENT SPOTLIGHT: MAE WILLIAMS ’14G A TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY PRESERVATIONIST 12 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 When Mae Williams ’14G enrolled in the Master of Arts in Historic Preservation program in the fall of 2012, she was drawn to the strength of a program in which, she says, “The professors are not academics locked away amidst a pile of books, but are actually out in the field on a daily basis, applying the information they are presenting in the classroom.” Below, she writes about one course that was especially meaningful to her, Sustainability in Historic Preservation, which allowed her to explore environmentally responsible historic preservation solutions to real-world challenges. I WAS PARTICULARLY DRAWN to the Sustainability in Historic Preservation course because of my background. I grew up in a passive solar house, built by my architect father with the aid of a Carter Administration grant. My parents raised me in a household with a large, organically farmed garden and fostered my love of the natural world. After earning my undergraduate degree in art history, I found myself struggling to find a niche where I could couple my interest in sustainability with my love of history. I spent time in the curatorial department at Canterbury Shaker Village and as a program assistant for the Division of Historical Resources. I worked for the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture and then for a local non-profit conservation group. The historic preservation program, and in particular this course, finally seemed to offer me a way to blend these two seemingly disconnected worlds. The Sustainability in Historic Preservation course focused on how we can use historic preservation as a tool not just for climate change mitigation but also as a way of creating economic growth. As our climate changes, and the way in which we use space evolves, it is important to seek creative solutions to space needs while respecting not only our built environment but also the energy embodied in existing infrastructure. In this light, preservation shifts from the limited realm of local historical societies to common sense policy. Historically, towns and cities were densely packed with mixed-use walkable neighborhoods. Outside these dense centers were large tracts of farmland and forests, providing for the urban areas. Our modern world is reliant on automobiles to shuttle us around suburban shopping malls that are gradually spreading farther and farther away from town centers where vacant shops sit neglected and forgotten. Historic preservation is often viewed as an elitist and expensive venture, but in reality it can be a tool to create local jobs and a sustainable economy. Compared to similar-scale new construction, historic preservation creates more jobs. Preservation is extremely labor intensive and requires less material than new construction. A higher percentage of project costs can go directly to local craftsmen. For this class, I spent a lot of time researching the Laconia (NH) State School property and exploring some of the options for the future of the site. The course material had to be applied to identify specific obstacles and opportunities associated with the site, as well as research into how similar sites have been addressed elsewhere. In particular this course made us look past preservation as simply a collection of theories as we took those ephemeral concepts and applied them to a real-life scenario. Laconia State School is a site that faces many challenges. The campus is vast, with 222.4 acres and 33 buildings and structures. The location has been largely vacant since it was formally closed in 1991 and the empty buildings have deteriorated rapidly. The site has environmental issues, including buried oil tanks, the potential for pesticide and insecticide leachage near some of the outbuildings, solid waste, asbestos, sludge beds related to a former sewage treatment plant, lead paint, mold, and PCBs (manmade organic pollutants). Additionally, Laconia State School is associated with an era of our history that we may not want to remember, where the mentally ill were sometimes Previous page and below: Mae Williams ’14G and the interior of the beautiful Bath Congregational Church she helped to get listed on the NH Historical Register.

Plymouth State University ~ plymouth.edu/magazine 13 mistreated and kept separate from society. Any potential redevelopment efforts must be sensitive to this. Many states and municipalities throughout the country struggle with what to do with similar proper-ties. The land for Laconia State School was originally chosen because of the woodlot and farming potential to create a self-reliant community. Like many similar campuses, Laconia State School has its own electrical steam plant to supply heat to most of the buildings. All buildings on the campus are currently connected to PSNH electrical service, Winnipesaukee River Basin Program Waste Water system, and city drinking water. Many of the buildings on the campus are brick and concrete, materials that are generally less expensive to renovate than wooden structures. Reuse of the site must utilize these features to be sustainable. Across the nation, other former mental institutions are slowly being transformed into mixed-use communities with residential and commercial areas. The Lakes Region Community College and Belknap County Economic Development Council have suggested that the site be used as an educational complex. Perhaps Laconia State School could be renovated in a phased development that utilizes these structures and the farmland on which they sit, returning much of the land to its historically intended use. Future use of the site might incorporate the community gardens just across the street, creating a community out-reach program to teach sustainable gardening and the use of seasonally available foods. This course ... helped me bridge the gap between the important preservation theory presented in other classes and the daily application of those concepts. As a twenty-first-century preservationist, I know I will find myself facing similarly complex issues over and over again. I will need to constantly re-examine new studies on the economic and environmental impact of preservation as I try to convince the world that preservation is green. This course, in particular, helped me bridge the gap between the important preservation theory presented in other classes and the daily application of those concepts. Now I feel more able to explain why preservation is important to our society as we move forward.

IN THE FALL OF 2013, computer science and technology major Alex Murphy ’14 was headed to Boston to seek internships and part-time work. This is where his family is and, as he says, there is a plethora of computer science and information technology jobs in that area. But when he learned of a software support and Web services administrator internship at the Enterprise Center at Plymouth’s anchor tenant, a real estate appraisal software company called Narrative1, this computer science and technology major jumped at the opportunity to stay in the area. While at Narrative1, Murphy connected with TotalScope Marketing, another ECP member business, and soon began interning as a Web developer for them as well. An avid mountain biker and backcountry skier, Murphy was eager to balance his desire to find good work in his own field with a lifestyle that keeps him happy and healthy. Plus, as he says, you can’t beat the location: “Considering these internships were practically 300 yards from the center of campus, the location is second to none. I live, work, and attend university all within the same square half-mile.” The training in Web development and user experience Murphy acquired during his internships proved beneficial both academically and professionally. “Many components of my senior project, a web-based recordkeeping system for a local homeless shelter, could not have been built without the valuable experience I gained at both Narrative1 and TotalScope Marketing,” he says. And at a time when many college graduates are struggling to find work, Murphy was able to land permanent employment before graduation as a Web developer, thanks to his academic preparation and business experience. Plymouth State University ~ plymouth.edu/magazine 15 PLYMOUTH “We’re trying to build our culture around young people who might want to stay in the area. We can give them a work environment that meets their balance of life goals: a good career and a great place to live.” —Mark LaClair 16 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 ECP Member Businesses: Small-Town Community with Big-City Dividends Mark LaClair, chair of the Grafton County Economic Development Council (GCEDC) and managing partner of TotalScope Marketing, appreciates the collegiality among the businesses in the ECP. “We’re always going to each other’s offices, borrowing knowledge, and borrowing supplies,” he says. “Ideas generate between two business tenants over a cup of coffee, or problems are solved just by asking somebody else who’s trying to make their own way. The atmosphere here is a story nobody expects when they come in. We knew we were going to get the University, but what we also got was each other.” Narrative1 COO Tim Corbitt notes that employees of his company often work with other businesses in the ECP to share resources and tackle projects that they may not have been able to do themselves. He also appreciates the way the larger community takes advantage of the ECP’s programs and resources. “We’re a more traditional client trying to build a high-tech business,” Corbitt says, “but it really impresses me the number of nontech, non-traditional businesses that come in here for support, from the dentist’s office right in town to small farms in the area, people producing wool or making cheese; it’s just terrific to bring us all together.” Any small business in the region is welcome to attend the free or low-cost workshops and seminars organized by the GCEDC and PSU’s College of Business Administration. Recent programming includes retirement planning for small businesses, social media marketing, e-mail boot camp, and preparing balance sheets for investor scrutiny. Hand in Hand with PSU Although the companies that lease space in the ECP specialize in different fields, from finance to marketing to software, they share a commitment to leveraging the partnership with Plymouth State University faculty and students. The proximity is a major draw for businesses and student interns alike. Corbitt notes that “it’s only a 40-foot-wide street, but it’s a pretty big gap unless you have something to bring people here. The programs we have between the two sides of the street close that gap nicely.” His company consults frequently with PSU College of Business Administration faculty Bob Nadeau and Terri Dautcher on ways Narrative1 can properly scale itself as it grows. Nadeau, Dautcher, and other faculty are also crucial to Narrative1’s process of recruiting interns and part-time employees who have been trained in their degree program to work on very specific marketing, Web, or technical projects. “The nice thing about this is that it’s not just an internship for one semester,” says Corbitt. “Every one of the students work both as an intern and as a part-time employee; typically they continue on after their internship is done and throughout the rest of their time at Plymouth State. Our objective and hope is that they will start their careers here. None of that would really be feasible without being physically here next to the campus and without the services we have as part of this incubator.” Narrative1 has goals and growth plans that mean it will outgrow the ECP—tenants are expected to make way for other small businesses after two to five years—but Corbitt is not worried: he believes the personal relationships his company has developed with faculty and students will sustain the partnership long after Narrative1 has left the ECP. TotalScope’s LaClair sees in the ECP-PSU partnership a chance for students to remain in the area and make a solid living and for businesses like his to access a “set of skills, youth, and energy” that allows them to be competitive and creative. “These Michael Tentnowski, executive director of the ECP, leads a popular seminar on running a professional consulting business.

His goal is to transform some of that raw energy and base knowledge into marketable career skills. Life After PSU ECP business owners are keenly aware of the aging demographic in New Hampshire, and the urgent need to attract and keep young people in the state. Creating a close-knit professional community benefits businesses and students alike, and may go a long way toward keeping educated young people in New Hampshire. “Companies like ours that continue to grow will create a new business environment in the region,” says Corbitt. “But the near-term challenge is keeping the interns here after graduation, beyond the romance of the internship and into the reality of the workforce.” LaClair says TotalScope works to help PSU students understand that an internship can mean more than just course credit; it can mean employment in a region they have come to love. “That marketing intern who works with us for a summer realizes she could actually get a job after graduation doing marketing right here where she wants to be,” he says. “We’re trying to build our culture around young people who might want to stay in the area. We can give them a work environment that meets their balance of life goals: a good career and a great place to live.” Mark LaClair (left) and Tim Corbitt share more than space in the same building: the informal exchange of ideas and resources among business tenants is one key to the success of the ECP as an incubator and business accelerator.

Exhibition curator Sarah Garlick writes about the connections between earth science, adventure, and the process of learning STEM in the Museum of the White Mountains’ latest show.

Plymouth State University ~ plymouth.edu/magazine 19 If you watch children playing outside--at the beach, along the banks of a stream, even on a playground—it doesn’t take long to recognize an almost universal fascination with rocks. Kids pick up stones, notice their shapes, textures, and weight. They hunt for crystals and seek out bare exposures of rock in just about any setting. But for many adults, we’ve lost that fascination as we’ve grown older. Many of us have become conditioned along the way to think about rocks and geology as boring, or perhaps too complicated or difficult, or simply not relevant to our lives. But if you think about our world today, as we face the impacts of a changing climate, as economies and technologies around the world grapple with limited natural resources, and as our headlines are dominated by natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and mud slides, one could argue that the science of the Earth is the most critical discipline of our time. Last March, the Museum of the White Mountains--Plymouth State University’s transdisciplinary center for White Mountains history, culture, and environmental legacy--opened its doors to a new exhibition that dives headfirst into the world of Earth science. This exhibition, Beyond Granite: the Geology of Adventure, explores the connections between outdoor recreation in the mountains and the science of the landscape itself. The exhibition focuses on the experiences of hikers, climbers, skiers, and snowboarders in the White Mountains, and ties these stories to the underlying history of the bedrock and mountainous topography. As the guest curator for the show, my goal was to bring the science of geology close to home—to tap into that original delight in rocks and nature that many of us first experienced as kids picking up pebbles in our driveways and yards and connect it to the world-class recreation opportunities that millions of people enjoy each year in the mountains of New Hampshire. At the heart of the exhibition are large-format panoramas of three iconic locations in the White Mountains: Cannon Cliff, the Franconia Ridge, and Mt. Washington. These images are called GigaPans—gigapixel panoramas— and they are created using a robotic mount connected to a camera, allowing the photographer to systematically shoot hundreds of images for a single scene that Contrary to old notions, the process of learning science is not as simple as filling up an empty brain with facts and concepts. 20 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 are later stitched together into one photograph using a computer. The resulting photos contain billions of pixels, which means they can be printed to enormous sizes while maintaining high resolution, and in the digital format, users have the ability to deeply zoom into a scene. Adventure cinematographer and photographer Jim Surette of North Conway shot the three GigaPans featured in Beyond Granite. “It was an adventure just to capture the GigaPans,” Surette says. “Each GigaPan is a composite of over 500 individual images. They take hours to capture and process and conditions have to be perfect. But the result is worth it. The level of detail you can zoom into is incredible. The technology reveals a new way to look at the mountains.”   While the technology for creating GigaPans has been around since 2008, the use of GigaPans as a tool to support science learning is an area of emerging education research. To bring GigaPans into the Museum of the White Mountains, I worked with a team of researchers from the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Learning in Out of School Environments (UP-CLOSE) and Carnegie Mellon University’s Community Robotics Education and Technology Empowerment Lab (CREATE Lab). This group, which includes researchers who helped develop the technology for NASA’s Mars Rovers, has been experimenting with technological platforms for enhancing science learning in museums and other settings via these deepzoomable images. Through our collaboration, we adapted one of the team’s experimental program designs to fit content from the White Mountains. We built a computer kiosk with a touch screen that allows museum visitors to use their fingertips to explore Cannon Cliff, the Franconia Ridge, and the east sides of Mt. Washington, Mt. Madison, and Mt. Adams in an entirely new manner than ever before. We embedded stories, diagrams, and photographs from important locations within each image to support discovery and learning. For example, on the Cannon Cliff GigaPan, you can zoom into the talus field and learn about talus formation or zoom into the old turnbuckles that once secured the Old Man of the Mountain and read about its geological origins and collapse. You can then pan over to the Black Dike and read about its hair-raising solo first ascent by ice climber John Bouchard in 1971. To experience the full impact of the GigaPans, we printed them for physical display on the museum walls in addition to their digital display on the touch-screen kiosk. Each panorama spans three feet in height and 12–14 feet in length. We used a special large-format printer that allowed us to install these photographs directly onto the gallery walls—there are no frames or panes of glass to separate viewers from the scene. You can get up close and trace details like climbing routes and trails and geologic features like fracture patterns, landslide scars, and the shapes of the ravines. As a science educator, I believe that the GigaPans in Beyond Granite have provided an exciting opportunity to bring new technologies and research-based exhibit design to the Museum of the White Mountains. As a lover of science and nature and as an avid climber, hiker, and skier, I also find the GigaPans to be cool. Feedback we’ve received has shown that many museum visitors feel the same way. As it turns out, these two perspectives, one of education and one of enjoyment, aren’t as unrelated as they might seem. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences released a consensus report in 2010 about how people learn science in informal, out-of-school settings. Contrary to old notions, the process of learning science is not as simple as filling up an empty brain with facts and concepts. Instead, education researchers now recognize learning as a social and context-driven process, and that learning science encompasses much more than building conceptual knowledge. The process of science learning, something that occurs Above and opposite: Sandwich Central School 4th and 5th graders explored the multimedia and hands-on displays during a field trip to the museum last spring.

Plymouth State University ~ plymouth.edu/magazine 21 throughout and across many settings of one’s life, includes several distinct aspects, or strands, as learning researchers call them. These strands include sparking interest and excitement, understanding content and knowledge, engaging in scientific reasoning, reflecting on science as a way of knowing, using the tools and language of science, and identifying with the scientific enterprise—thinking of oneself as someone who learns about science [1]. As the Beyond Granite exhibition evolved from an idea to an outline to a complete show, I worked with the museum staff and an advisory board of geologists to weave these different strands into the exhibit design. For example, one of the foundational aspects of science learning is experiencing excitement, interest, and motivation to learn about phenomena in the natural and physical world [1]. This is at the core of Beyond Granite—the strength of the ties between science and the activities and places people love. Also, the use of the GigaPans provides an opportunity for the exhibition to support aspects of scientific reasoning, another important strand of how we learn science. As visitors Beyond Granite: the Geology of Adventure, curated by Sarah Garlick, is on display at the Museum of the White Mountains until March 8, 2015. Garlick is an award-winning author of Flakes, Jugs, and Splitters: A Rock Climber’s Guide to Geology, and National Geographic’s Pocket Guide to Rocks and Minerals. She is the director of science, policy, and outreach for the Hubbard Brook Research Foundation. [1] Fenichel, M., and Schweingruber, H.A. (2010).

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. interact with the GigaPans, both in digital form and in their large-format prints, they engage in acts of exploration, observation, questioning, and making sense of the natural and physical world. These are key science reasoning skills. Under the leadership of museum director Catherine Amidon, the educational impacts of Beyond Granite—and all exhibitions at the Museum of the White Mountains— are designed to reach far beyond the walls of 34 Highland Street. As with all of the museum’s collections and shows, images, videos, materials, and texts are made available for free to anyone and everyone via the museum’s website. Also, the museum has released standards-based lessons based on the exhibit that are available for free to New Hampshire teachers and are divided into elementary, middle, and high school levels. These lessons, designed by science education consultant Jackie Wilson, provide easy-to-adapt frameworks for teachers to bring the geology of the White Mountains and the thrill of outdoor recreation into their classrooms. This last point—the thrill of experiencing the mountains, whether out on a casual walk or in the vertical plane of a rock climb—is what Beyond Granite is all about. This show, like the underlying mission of the institution that houses it, is a celebration of this magnificent region many of us have the good fortune to call home. I hope that at least some museum visitors come away feeling like I do, that science doesn’t have to be a separate, technical, and intimidating discipline, that it is woven into our everyday experiences and is an opportunity to deepen and enrich our lives. plymouth.edu/museum-of-the-white-mountains ~ barbra alan 22 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 On the Mark: ALLW ell North at Plymouth State University Architect’s renderings of lower lobby entry (left) exterior (above) and indoor track facilities (bottom left) of ALLWell North. Sasaki Associates. Plymouth State University ~ plymouth.edu/magazine 23 The construction of Plymouth State University’s newest building, the Active Living, Learning, and Wellness Center (ALLWell North), marks an exciting moment in the University’s long history of service to New Hampshire, with special emphasis on the North Country and Lakes Region, highlights its critical roles in contributing to the state’s economic base and preparing an educated workforce. ALLWell North will be a boon to the state and region. When it opens in fall 2015, the 107,600-square-foot facility will provide new indoor fitness and recreational opportunities for the community, accommodate up to 6,000 people for regional events and performances, and allow the University to host large-scale track and field events for the state and region. Further, ALLWell North will create an estimated $4 million annual economic impact for the region through job creation, visitor spending, and additional procurement by the University. 24 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 Building on Success ALLWell North is the second phase of a multiphase building plan for the east side of campus and will be the greatest transformation in academic and campus life at PSU to date. The first phase, the PSU Ice Arena and Welcome Center, completed in 2010, has enhanced academics, athletics, and recreation for the University and beyond. Exercise and sport physiology students use the ice rink to conduct testing on student-athletes to assess their fitness levels, and athletic training students use the facility as one of their clinical rotation sites. The ice arena has also provided a much-needed venue for exercise and events such as open skating and skating lessons, hockey, broomball, and, most recently curling—all of which are available to campus and community members. Skating on home ice, increased seating for fans, and attracting highly regarded recruits eager to play in a beautiful arena have improved the performance of the PSU’s men’s and women’s ice hockey teams. Since the facility opened in fall 2010, the men’s hockey team has played in three straight collegiate championships. The PSU Ice Arena and Welcome Center also established a more attractive and welcoming entrance to campus on Holderness Road, an entrance that will continue to be enhanced by ALLWell North and the new green spaces surrounding it that figure prominently into the plan. Regional Benefits The educational, research, and recreational activities that will take place in ALLWell North will have major implications for the health and wellness of our region. PSU’s Department of Health and Human Performance—the University’s second-largest department— engages graduate and undergraduate students in rigorous coursework and collaborations with faculty who are conducting cutting-edge research, such as fall risk assessment for senior citizens, the impact of concussion in athletes, and the benefits of staying active throughout the life span. In ALLWell North, classroom and hands-on learning will occur under one roof thanks to the building’s large-scale, multi-use space and retractable partitions that create classrooms and research laboratories. “Successfully preparing future health and wellness professionals requires a synergy between academic and experiential learning,” says Julie Bernier, PSU provost and vice president for academic affairs. “Our students will be better prepared to serve the region because of how ALLWell North integrates academics, athletics, and recreation on one site.” Better-prepared students lead to high-quality health and wellness professionals who benefit the schools, hospitals, clinics, social service agencies, rehabilitation centers, and health and fitness facilities in which they work throughout New Hampshire and New England. The PSU Ice Arena and Welcome Center, completed in 2010, has already greatly enhanced academics, athletics, and recreation for the University and beyond. Kyle Simard ’17 photo. ALLWELL NORTH WILL INCLUDE SPACE FOR: teaching + research athletic training adventure education fitness + strength training cardio classes Plymouth State University ~ plymouth.edu/magazine 25 “ALLWell North will include an athletic training room where athletic training students like me will practice our skills at evaluating, treating, and caring for athletes who compete in and around the building: cross country and indoor and outdoor track and field athletes to begin with, and eventually football and other outdoor sports teams,” says Brendan Curtin ’15. ALLWell North will also provide a home to the University’s Center for Active Living and Healthy Communities, a center for education, research, and community partnerships that attracts grant support and research dollars to the state. Rebecca Busanich, assistant director of the center, is currently involved in a research project that could shine light on the complexities and benefits of physical activity for those with disabilities as well as support the work of local non-profit organizations like Adaptive Sports Partners of the North Country (ASPNC), which aim to support such experiences through evidence-based practice. Tourism and recreation are two of New Hampshire’s most important industries, and are major economic “Successfully preparing future health and wellness professionals requires a synergy between academic and experiential learning. Our students will be better prepared to serve the region because of how ALLWell North integrates academics, athletics, and recreation on one site.” —JULIE BERNIER, PSU PROVOST AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS drivers for the state. Highly trained adventure education professionals are in demand by local and regional employers. ALLWell North will help prepare students for careers in outdoor leadership, adventure education, state and national park outdoor education, therapeutic adventure, environmental education, and recreation. “There is no institution better situated than PSU, in the midst of our vast natural resources of the Lakes Region and the White Mountains, to train the future leaders in the expanding field of adventure and outdoor programming,” says Jeffrey Rose, commissioner of New Hampshire’s Department of Resources of Economic Development. Student Benefits While the state and region will benefit greatly from the presence of ALLWell North on campus, the state-of-the-art building will establish an attractive, welcoming entrance to the campus; enhance PSU’s faculty and student recruitment efforts; and transform the academic and athletic experience for more than 75 percent of the student body who will use the building as a classroom, as varsity competition and training space, as a place to participate in intramural sports, and other recreational opportunities. ALLWell North begins the transition out of the school’s current Physical Education Center that opened in 1968 to serve a campus of 1,800 students. Considered one of the finest collegelevel facilities when built, the PE Center now lags far behind in serving a campus of 7,000 students and 24 men’s and women’s varsity athletic teams. Larry Haynes ’86, president of the PSU President’s Council and CEO of Grappone Automotive Group in Bow, NH, says ALLWell North will make PSU more competitive, both in admissions and in athletics. “When prospective students see that your facilities are outdated, they’re not going to come here,” he says. “With ALLWell North on campus, just think of the return on investment in terms of student recruitment, athletic competitiveness, and graduate preparation.” Double the size of the current field house, ALLWell North allows for a wide range of activities to take place simultaneously, maximizing the building’s usefulness. Among 26 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 ALLWell North’s key features are more locker rooms and restrooms, indoor tennis courts, and a full-size track, which will allow PSU to proudly host regional track and field events and bring back its varsity track and field teams. Reinstating PSU varsity track and field is welcome news to alumnus George Davis ’63, founding coach of UMass Lowell’s cross country and track and field programs, a member of three track and field halls of fame, and 20-time NCAA Division II Coach of the Year Award recipient. “I remember the [first] track program at PSU—when it was dropped, I was devastated,” he says. When PSU asked Davis to serve as a consultant on the new 200-meter track, he jumped at the chance to be part of his alma mater’s latest venture. Helping plan and design the track was, he says, “one of the great experiences I’ve had in my professional career … to help this become the great facility that it will be.” In recognition of Davis’s distinguished career and his love for PSU, Davis’s son Kevin recently honored him with a major gift in support of ALLWell North. The track that Davis worked so hard to help plan and design will be named the George E. Davis ’63 Track. (Learn more about this meaningful gift on the inside back cover of this magazine.) Stewarding Financial Resources While the advantages of ALLWell North to both the region and the campus are abundant, the decision to build a new facility on campus was made only after careful resource planning and consideration. In recent years, the University has had to commit $1.75 million annually simply to maintain the outdated PE Center. Continuing that expense is imprudent, and a recent external study concluded that replacing the facility is more cost-effective than continuing to repair or renovate it, while also reducing the University’s maintenance backlog and addressing safety and accessibility concerns. Guided by the University’s Strategic Plan and 10-year Campus Master Plan, ALLWell North will solidify PSU’s niche as an established leader in the education and training of health and wellness professionals. Breaking Ground, Gaining Momentum Thanks to support from generous alumni and friends, the Campaign for ALLWell North is well under way with just over a half-million dollars in gifts and pledges toward an overall goal of raising $1.5 million in private support by June 30, 2015. Plymouth area business owners and community leaders Don ’84, ’98G and Arlene ’83 Stoppe were the first to step forward with a major gift for the project. The Stoppes, who personify active living and healthy lifestyles themselves, generously supported the construction of the ice arena and welcome center and are dedicated to helping their alma mater transform health and wellness throughout the region. Stoppe believes that ALLWell North will give a tremendous boost to alumni pride, and expects it to draw more alumni and families to campus, whether it’s for a game, an alumni event, or an admissions open house. “This is what we want for our school,” he says. “We want our athletics teams to succeed; we want enrollment to increase; and we want our alma mater to be recognized for its teaching and research. We want to bring our children, our nieces, our nephews—the young people in our lives—back to campus and say, ‘This is where I went to college’ with pride.” To learn how you can support ALLWell North, contact John Scheinman at 603) 535-2805 or jscheinman@plymouth.edu. “ALLWell North will include an athletic training room where athletic training students like me will practice our skills at evaluating, treating, and caring for athletes who compete in and around the building: cross country and indoor and outdoor track and field athletes to begin with, and eventually football and other outdoor sports teams.” —BRENDAN CURTIN ’15 Jeremy Gasowski ’01 photo.

I was honored to serve on the search committee with fellow alumni Gene Martin ’09, chair of the Alumni Association Board of Directors; faculty members Linda Levy ’04CAGS and Roxana Wright ’01G; Director of Alumni Relations Rodney Ekstrom ’09G; and chair of the search Vice President for Enrollment Management and Student Affairs Jim Hundrieser ’90G. Other search committee members were Marcia Schmidt Blaine, Patrick May, and Jonathan Santore of the faculty, Dean Cynthia Vascak, and Assistant Vice President of University Advancement Laure Morris. Together we were able to define what qualities were most important to the next vice president and then work with a leading Boston search firm specializing in advancement leadership that brought forward a healthy pool of extremely qualified candidates. Of those, Paula Lee Hobson emerged as our top candidate and ultimately the new vice president. Like other members of the search committee, I was impressed by her academic credentials, her knowledge of alumni relations and fundraising, and her experience in building successful programs at a larger public institution in Nevada. From my own perspective in the private sector, her marketing career in private industry before higher education is a great benefit, too. Beyond these professional qualities, Paula Lee is a presence—personally warm and engaging, she brings an excitement and optimism to every room she enters. I remember thinking she is the kind of leader who would truly take Plymouth State’s alumni outreach and fundraising to the next level. As Gene Martin said, “She ‘gets’ us.” The student and alumni constituency at Truckee Meadow Community College in Nevada, where she built the advancement operation over 15 years, also skews heavily toward those who are the first generation in their families to attend college. “She was first-gen herself, at the University of Oregon, so she really understands public higher education and our kind of alumni,” Gene commented. With this as a strong foundation, I believe Paula Lee can help move Plymouth State quickly into deeper contact with and more meaningful involvement of our alumni and more robust fundraising for our future. At the beginning of her tenure at Truckee Meadow, they raised about the same level of annual private support as Plymouth State does now— between $1 and $3 million in gifts and pledges. She planned and led a campaign that resulted in more than $25 million in major gifts from a wide variety of stakeholders, including alumni, faculty, staff, businesses and regional partners, even seasonal residents. I look forward to collaborating with her and the advancement team to do the same at Plymouth State. President Steen also recognized Paula Lee’s marketing, public relations, and advertising expertise and education—her master’s degree thesis topic was integrated marketing communications in higher education. She soon tapped Paula Lee to integrate the former Office of Public Relations and Marketing staff into University Advancement. The newly formed team of 30 professionals will positively impact all facets of advancement, especially alumni. In late summer after relocating her family from Reno to Center Harbor, Paula Lee told me, “My husband Paul and I are putting down roots in a small town and a tight-knit university community for our ten-year-old twins. This position at Plymouth State is the realization of both a professional and a personal goal for us.” I hope you will have a chance to meet and personally welcome Paula Lee to PSU on your next visit to campus or at an upcoming alumni event. —Larry Haynes ’86, President’s Council Chair PSUAA Board Chair Gene Martin ’09, VP Paula Lee Hobson, and President’s Council Chair Larry Haynes ’86.

The open houses are an opportunity for prospective students, their family members, and occasionally a friend or two to visit campus for one last tour before confirming their college decision. We met and spoke with many legacy families—students with parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles—who are alumni. These students and their families shared that tradition plays an important role in the student’s decision-making process, as does the quality of Plymouth State’s academic and co-curricular programming. One of the legacy families we met was Judy Dodge ’88 and daughter, Meghan (right). “Meghan has always wanted to be a teacher,” says Judy, who earned a BS in Elementary Education and worked for many years as a special education teacher. “I hoped that she would consider PSU, but I didn’t push.” About her college choice, Meghan says, “I didn’t want to choose PSU just because my mom attended. I looked at other schools and since I want to be teacher, PSU quickly became the best choice.” “I’m excited for Meghan to get involved and to pursue all the great opportunities that PSU has to offer,” Judy says. “There have been so many great changes since I attended—walking paths in place of roads, renovated buildings. But it still feels like the Plymouth State I remember.” Meghan joined PSU in September as a member of the class of 2018. “I think it’s really cool that we’ll both be Plymouth State graduates!”— Rodney Ekstrom ’09G EXCHANGING VOWS Anne Poirier ’85 and Timothy Drown ’85, October 11, 2013 Wayne Oldack ’98 and Veronica Mueller ’98, January 25, 2012 Jodi (Makuch) Aspinwall ’98 and Todd Aspinwall ’99, December 30, 2013 Angela (Uhlman) Preisendorfer ’98, ’09G and Justin Preisendorfer, October 5, 2013 Heidi Pettigrew ’99, ’07G, ’11CAGS and Paula Currie, July 12, 2014 Caitlin (Vogt) Fullerton ’09 and Justin Fullerton ’06, July 10, 2010 Lindsay (Scialdone) Haarlander ’08 and Jesse Haarlander ’09, July 20, 2013 Jesse Rolland ’08 and Cassandra (Taylor) Rolland, October 6, 2013 Katie (Dexter) Parent ’10 and Shayne Parent ’10, August 4, 2013 Sarah (Airozo) Feeny ’10 and Bob Feeny ’10, June 21, 2014 Emily (Burwen) Woodward ’10 and Doug Woodward, October 12, 2013 Thomas Holden ’12 and Emily Niemi, July 25, 2014 Joshua “Jay” Clyde (Hunter) Siedenberg ’12 and Tyler James Seidenberg ’14, June 7, 2014 Have multiple members of your family or extended family attended Plymouth State?

Matt’s inspiration had come while waiting tables at a pizza shop in Portland, Maine. He’d tired of lackluster root beers and set out to create something better tasting and more environmentally responsible. Matthew had already taken the first entrepreneurial steps himself, selling the root beer out of his truck, when Mark gave up his job in software sales to help grow and run the business. Now, ten years later, Maine Root is found on store shelves from the USA to the UK to Hong Kong, and in flavors like Blueberry and Mandarin Orange. Keith Bouchard ’14 talked with Mark to hear his take on life as an entrepreneur in the beverage industry. Maine Root is marketed as an environmentally responsible soda product. What makes Maine Root different? Maine Root uses Fair Trade Organic Cane Juice (FTOCJ) as our primary ingredient instead of genetically modified high fructose corn syrup. Organic Cane Juice is grown without genetic modification, petrochemical fertilizers, or pesticides. We pay about 10 percent more for our FTOCJ. That money is invested in the communities where the cane is grown in Paraguay. Schools, hospitals, and equipment are purchased and built to keep the communities moving in a positive direction. Has your vision for Maine Root changed as it has grown from a small, local company to an international distributor? We set out to build the best self-funded, and most socially conscious beverage company known to man. That vision has not changed. In your role as president and CEO, has there been an “a-ha” moment that has changed your perspective on leadership or Maine Root’s potential for growth? Yes, every day there’s an “a-ha” moment. The biggest “a-ha” came before I was at Maine Root. It was about 20 years ago at a software company where I was watching and working with individuals who had extremely high IQs. They were absolutely committed to the core of their DNA that they were going to take over Earth. When I first heard them roll out their vision, I laughed, and they stared back with a look I’ll never forget. If I wasn’t on board I needed to hit the bricks that minute. It helped me understand where to find the seventh gear overdrive that not many people push hard enough to ever find. Long story short, figure out how you want to spend your time, what it’s going to take to get there, set your sights high, and keep going. How would you describe a day at the Maine Root office? Hammer down. Who do you consider to be a role model or mentor? Any salesperson who is out there banging doors and hitting the phones harder than everyone else, or just pushing themselves to make that one extra call per day when they are worn out and ready to call it a day. People who are still learning how to do new things, helping others on their way up, and giving the people the motivational nudge they might need to go harder than they think they can go. Think about Maine Root five years from now. What does the company look like and what have you accomplished? At our average growth rate, we’ll be 3.2 times bigger than we are now. Maine Root will have the same things going on, just 3.2 times more of it. Okay, now for the hard-hitting question: If aliens visited Earth for a bottle of Maine Root, what flavor would you choose for them and why? Ginger brew because it’s so different from other brands. It really kicks hard!

Currier. John P. Clark. Richard T. Hage. Each of these notable Plymouth State figures played a pivotal role in developing the interest and work ethic that has made Stephen J. Sedensky III ’80 one of New England’s most influential prosecutors. read on &gt;&gt; 36 Plymouth Magazine ~ Fall 2014 Sedensky, the State’s Attorney in the district of Danbury, CT, received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from his alma mater at this year’s Commencement Ceremony. “My Plymouth State football experience with Coach Currier has proven to be a tremendous asset in the competitive nature of my work,” Sedensky says. “He taught me the importance of preparation and that’s really where my cases are won or lost.” Similarly, participation on the student judicial board led by Dean Hage and serving as student government treasurer under advisor John Clark ’70, ’73G, provided the foundation for what would become an extraordinary career in public service. Immediately following graduation from Plymouth State, Sedensky entered the Suffolk University School of Law in Boston. A summer internship in the prosecutor’s office of his hometown in Bridgeport, CT, listening to victims’ accounts of crimes moved him to seek justice for them. He wanted to make a difference in the community where he’d grown up as the oldest of seven children. “I’d grown up with exposure to the law since my dad is an attorney, too,” Sedensky says. But there was also the influence of his parents’ involvement in the community. His father served as an alderman and a member of the board of education; his mother was a former teacher deeply involved in volunteer duties at school and church. Sedensky and his siblings knew they were expected to devote their lives to something greater than themselves. For Sedensky, it would eventually become setting new standards for the state of Connecticut’s prosecution of child abuse cases—an interdisciplinary approach involving law enforcement investigators, social workers, and public agency officials collaborating with attorneys and prosecutors. The child interview training model and legal investigative practices he introduced in Connecticut have been adopted by 18 states and two foreign countries, significantly improving the conviction rates of child abuse perpetrators. Child abuse became a focus after his successful prosecution of a Norwalk man charged with sexually assaulting a five-year-old Fairfield boy. Sedensky had the child testify at the trial through videotape—a first in Connecticut. THERE IS TREMENDOUS SATISFACTION IN CORRECTING INJUSTICES. I LOVE THIS WORK. Below: Sedensky coming off the field after battling it out under Coach Currier’s leadership (left) and addressing graduates at the 2014 Commencement Ceremony. (right, Jeremy Gasowski ’01 photo.) Photo previous page: courtesy of Autumn Driscoll/Connecticut Post ©2013 Hearst Conn Media Group. This important work was above and beyond the standard State’s Attorney duties Sedensky carries in leading his staff in criminal investigations, legal case-building, and courtroom trials. “There is tremendous satisfaction in correcting injustices,” he says. “I love this work.” Sedensky has been a guest lecturer in PSU Criminal Justice classes, sharing with students his experiences in and out of the courtroom. “It’s great to see the criminal justice program preparing more people to pursue careers in the field.” Sedensky is respected by attorneys, judges, victims, and their families for his meticulous preparation, tenacious work ethic, and uncompromising integrity. Over his 30-year career, he has successfully prosecuted cases drawing national attention, such as the 1995 case of a Trumbull, CT, school bus driver and self-proclaimed witch accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old boy, and the 2011 murder trial of a Danbury restaurant owner who fatally shot his uncle and dismembered the body with a handsaw. Yet nothing compares to the 2012 tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT. Sedensky led the criminal investigation and authored the final report summarizing what happened and why. He has been lauded for his service to and protection of the families, criticized for efforts to protect their privacy over the public’s right-to-know, and deeply admired for his dedication to finding the truth to gain whatever understanding could come from the tragedy. “Yes, in my work I see the worst in society,” reflects Sedensky. “But I still see the cup half-full. Once I leave the office, I’m fortunate to walk into another life with a great family, wonderful friends in town and at church—all good people.”—Laure A. Morris Kaleb Hart ’11 photo. “I never expected this in my lifetime,” says George, the founding coach of UMass Lowell’s cross country and track and field programs, a three-time Hall of Fame inductee, and a 20-time NCAA Division II Coach of the Year Award recipient. “I’m trying to put it in perspective somehow. All the track facilities I traveled to in my career, they were almost always named for someone. Now I’m one of those people.” The 200-meter George E. Davis ’63 Track is a key feature in ALLWell North (see story page 22) that will reestablish PSU’s varsity track and field program. It’s a fitting honor for George, a first-generation college student who credits his Plymouth State education as the foundation for his illustrious 33-year career, which includes coaching 78 All-Americans and 34 New England champions. “It means the world to our family to be able to recognize my dad’s accomplishments and his leadership in athletics at his favorite university, his alma mater,” says son Kevin, president and CEO of Bauer Performance Sports. “I hope this gift will inspire others to see the future and help the University and community continue to thrive.” “I never expected this in my lifetime.” At his 75th birthday celebration, George Davis ’63 received an unexpected gift from his son, Kevin. It was a framed photo of an architectural rendering, presented without explanation. George wasn’t wearing his glasses and was about to put it down when his grandson Ben said, “Look a little closer, Pops.” There it was in big, bold letters: GEORGE E. DAVIS ’63 TRACK Nonprofit Org.

Coming Soon: Merrill Place Residence Hall and Conference Center
Starting fall 2017, Plymouth State students will have a new residence hall to call home.
To accommodate its growing enrollment, the University recently began construction
on Merrill Place Residence Hall and Conference Center, a seven-story building that
will house up to 350 students. “Merrill Place’s design is in line with the evolving housing
preferences of today’s college student—rooms designed for more individualized use and
a higher ratio of bathroom facilities to students,” says Steve Taksar, vice president for
finance and administration. “Other amenities include air conditioning; bike storage; a
central, communal kitchen; a student lounge; and a game area.”
As the name implies, Merrill Place will also provide much-needed event space
on campus, with a first-floor conference center that will accommodate up to 500
students or summer guests for lecture-style events or up to 300 people for dinners
and other special events.
Centrally located on Merrill Street, across from Hyde Hall, the new building is
being constructed with a commitment to advanced energy efficiency and sustain-ability,
a University practice that began with the construction of Langdon Woods
Architect’s rendering courtesy of Perkins + Will, Boston, MA. Residential Complex in 2007. ■
From Korea with Gratitude
When Dan Lee stepped off the plane in California
back in 1990, the 20-year-old South Korean
émigré was seeking the American dream. After
earning an advanced degree in economics, he
accepted a job offer at PSU, believing the small-town
New England setting would be a good place
to raise his young family.
As an associate professor, he has established
himself as a go-to expert for the key decision mak-ers
who are guiding New Hampshire’s billion-dollar
tourism efforts by providing critical economic data
to the state. He also publishes a quarterly report,
the North Country Economic Index, which evalu-ates
economic trends to help businesses “north of
the notches” plan for the future.
“I don’t think I’ve accomplished enough
to feel proud yet. But it feels good to
give back unconditionally.”—Dan Lee

Lee is also helping the future of the Granite State in a less visible way: he’s teach-ing
young people how economics plays a role in supporting community businesses.
Two years ago, Lee organized an economics club at Plymouth Elementary School,
where children are taught how to analyze rudimentary data and create models to
help local businesspeople plan for success. His motivation? The desire to give back to
the place that embraced his dreams for a better life.
“I am an immigrant and this country has been really good to me. For a long time,
I wanted to do something good for this country, especially the children,” says Lee.
“Teaching kids that economics is about using data to make the best possible decision
is my way of giving back.”
Lee’s heartfelt “That I may serve” approach to the Plymouth area has so far
provided several dozen children with economics knowledge, which they turned into
valuable advice for a half-dozen businesses that applied their findings. Lee is happy
with his efforts so far, but he wants to achieve even more.
“I don’t think I’ve accomplished enough to feel proud yet,” he notes. “But it feels
good to give back unconditionally.”■ Bruce Lyndes

THEY’VE TAKEN THE
RAP FOR THE SPREAD
of the Bubonic Plague in
Medieval Europe. Their name is
synonymous with scoundrel, trai-tor,
and snitch. And then there are
their tails: long and skinny, pink
and seemingly hairless.
They’re rats, and they’re prob-ably
the last animals you’d think
would make great companions,
capable of bringing comfort to
people and helping those with
special needs. But did you know
that these highly sensitive animals
can be trained to warn their
humans about oncoming seizures
or spasms, or remind them to
take their medicine, with just a
lick of their little tongues? Or that
simple interaction with rats can
inspire smiles and laughs from
autistic children, and help them
develop their social skills? Or that
their soft fur and twitching noses
can raise the spirits of nursing
home residents?
Professor Clarissa Uttley is
on a mission to improve the rat’s
image, one student at a time.
Animals in the Classroom
Uttley began working with rats
as an education specialist at
the Capron Park Zoo in Attle-boro,
MA. “One of my favorite
programs to present was called
Animals That Nobody Loves,” she
says. From snakes and tarantulas
to opossums and rats, Uttley
would introduce visitors to some
of the world’s most reviled crea-tures
and debunk some myths in
the process. “Making the case for
misunderstood animals became
my passion, and watching the shift
in people’s thinking about these
animals inspired me to become
an educator and to research
human-animal interaction.”
For the past three years, Uttley
has taught the first-year seminar
course Can Animals Help Us
Heal? She invites guest speakers
and their animals—cats, dogs,
and horses—to campus, and
exposes students to the benefits
and challenges of including
animals in therapeutic interven-tions
and companionship. “Then
I encourage the students to
critically evaluate these practices
themselves,” she says.
Exposure Leads to Understanding
One semester, Uttley brought two
of her companion animals, rats
named Millie and Minkie, to class
and proceeded to demonstrate
how these highly intelligent,
trainable, and social animals
can help people with special
needs. “You can imagine what
some of the students said,” she
laughs. “But after learning the rats’
names and watching me interact
with them, the students became
more comfortable and several
wanted to hold or pet them. This
confirmed my hypothesis that
exposure to an unknown can lead
to better understanding.”
Some of Uttley’s students have
become so comfortable with
working with rats in class that
they’ve volunteered to care for
and work with them outside of
class. “Through prolonged inter-action
with their rats, students
ended up bonding with them,
and became concerned for their
well-being,” she says. In addition,
several students were invited to
bring their rats to PSU’s Center
for Young Children and Families
so the children there could
interact with them and care for
them. The rats quickly won the
hearts of the preschoolers.
While not all of Uttley’s stu-dents
completely warm up to the
rats, she says that by semester’s
end, they all report a positive
change in their attitude toward
them and a respect they never
thought they’d feel for these
much-maligned creatures.
Mission accomplished.

In addition to her teaching, Professor
Clarissa Uttley oversees the PSU
Pet-Assisted Therapy Program, which
gives students the opportunity to
interact with certified therapy pets
such as dogs and horses throughout the
semester. The program is a hit with stu-dents
looking to reduce stress, anxiety,
or homesickness—or who simply need
to snuggle with a furry friend.

SKI HARD,SMILE BIG
Freydis Holla Einarsdottir ’19 came this close
to competing in the 2014 Winter Olympics in
Sochi. Since coming to PSU, she’s been posting
top finishes for the women’s ski team, and in
March she became the first woman in Plymouth
State history to compete in the NCAA Champi-onships,
the biggest race in collegiate ski racing.
The best part? This first-year student-athlete is
just getting started.
Lauren Lavigne ’94, ’96G, assistant director
of athletics for enrollment management and
advancement, recently talked with the world-class
competitive ski racer from Gardabaer,
Iceland, to learn why she chose to study and
compete at PSU, what motivates her, and
what’s next for her.
Q: So. Just how close did you get to compet-ing
in the Winter Olympic games in Sochi?
The Iceland Olympic team sends one male
and one female skier to compete. If one of
those skiers is ranked among the top 500 in
the world, then the team gets another male
and another female racer. And if one of those
skiers is ranked in the top 250 in the world, the
team gets a third set of racers.
In 2014, my friend and I were fighting for that
third seed. The skier with the best score in
January 2014 would claim the spot. She had 33
points, I had 35 points—the lower the score, the
better in Alpine skiing. As it turned out, neither
of us got that third spot. But then, just five days
before the Olympics, the top female racer on
the Iceland team tore her ACL, and my friend
got to be on the team. If I had scored better in
January, I would have gotten to go.
Q: Why did you choose to come to the
US for college?
It had been a dream of mine for years. I’d been
to the US before, and every time I thought, “I
could live here.” Also, if I stayed in Iceland, I
wouldn’t be skiing, because the weather, the
mountains, and the snow aren’t at the level
where I could improve as a skier.
Q: Why Plymouth State University?
I was in the US last year for the world cham-pionships
and visited colleges. I never got a
chance to visit PSU, but I Skyped with Coach
[Andrew] Gannon a few times. He talked
about the Plymouth State experience, the
education, and the community. I wasn’t just
another racer to fill out his roster—I knew
he cared about me as a person and wanted to
make sure I chose the right school for me.
I also looked at what I wanted to study. I want
to do something that has to do with sports, the
human body, anatomy—the exercise and sport
physiology major was perfect!
Q: What’s the best part of being on the
Panther ski team?
I’ve been racing since the age of 7, and I’ve
never experienced this level of camaraderie.
The men’s and women’s teams here are basi-cally
one big family. Our motto is “Ski hard
and smile big.” It reminds us all how lucky we
are, and how much fun this sport is.
Q: What is your motivation each day when
you train?
Next year, the world championships are in
Switzerland. I want to be there. And I want
to compete in the 2018 Olympics in South

Korea. That’s my dream, to compete on the

Q: How are you preparing for the Olympics?
Coming to PSU was part of the process; I
can ski every day during the season. If I were
home, I wouldn’t be able to train every day.
The weather conditions and the training
opportunities aren’t good enough.
This summer and next summer will be a lot of
hard work—I’ll work with a personal trainer
while I’m at home, lifting and running. I’m
also going to try skiing on a glacier. We don’t
have summer skiing at home, but we have a lot
of glaciers. ■

Factor (CTGF), which plays a key
role in the body’s healing process.
Following a heart attack, or in the
case of cardiovascular disease,
“CTGF acts as a signaling mol-ecule,
telling different cytokines
[proteins], ‘Come here, we need to
help fix this,’” explains Kennedy.
“The question is, are there differ-ences
in each person’s CTGF gene
that affect the levels of fibrosis
severity that person develops?”
Since she arrived at PSU in fall
2014, Kennedy has been working
closely with her colleagues to
answer that question. She’s been
involved in just about every
aspect of the research, including
taking cell samples from healthy
subjects across campus via cheek
swab, extracting DNA from the
cells, and amplifying (copying)
regions of the CTGF gene so they
can be sequenced. The sequencing
is done at the Molecular Biology
Core Facility at Dartmouth
College, one of PSU’s biomedical
research partners.
Then Kennedy and her PSU
colleagues compare each individual
sequence to that of the published
human genome, which can be
found on various websites. “We
look for single-base differences, or
single nucleotide polymorphisms,”
says Kennedy. Single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) are the
most common genetic variation
among people. Researchers have
found SNPs that may help predict
an individual’s response to certain
drugs, susceptibility to toxins, and
risk of developing particular dis-eases.
“For the past year and a half,
we’ve been sending samples out
for sequencing and using this data
to compile a list of SNPs found in
the CTGF gene.”
The next phase of the project
is to introduce SNPs into a
tissue culture, and see how they
respond. How does it affect their
expression of CTGF? Do certain
SNPs cause higher expression
than others? These are just some
of the questions the researchers
will be considering.
Kennedy’s the first to admit
that lab work can be tedious:
“Nothing ever works the first
time,” she laments. “It’s constant
troubleshooting.”
But then there are those
moments of pure exhilaration that
make all the trial and error worth
it: “We had a region of a gene that
we couldn’t get a sequence for—
for over a year, nothing we did
worked,” she recalls. “Just recently,
we got it. After putting in all that
work, it was great to put the pieces
of that puzzle together.”
Regardless of the kind of day
she’s having in the lab, Kennedy
has gained a wealth of research
experience that could have
implications far beyond the lab
in Boyd. “This research could, in
the long-term, benefit people’s
health,” she says.
In the meantime, she’s prepar-ing
to graduate in May and defend
her thesis based on her research
later this summer.
Leaving PSU will be bitter-sweet,
as it also means leaving
the research project in which
she’s invested two years and so
much of herself. But work on the
project will continue in Boyd
Science Center, and Kennedy will
find new medical puzzles to help
solve. “I love being in the lab and
doing research related to human
health,” she says. “Whether it’s in
a university, a hospital, or a phar-maceutical
company, I definitely
plan to have a career in medical
research.” ■ Barbra Alan
A BROKEN HEART AND
A HEART ATTACK
MAY NOT HAVE very
much in common, but they’re
both painful in their own way,
and both can leave scars. Unlike
the scars that follow heartbreak,
scars following heart attack don’t
fade with time, and they often
prove fatal.
Cardiac fibrosis, or scarring of
the heart, develops after a heart
attack or as a result of cardiovas-cular
disease. This is part of the
healing process, much like when
skin develops scar tissue following
injury. Because people develop
cardiac fibrosis in varying levels of
severity, treating it can be a risky
proposition: both overtreatment
and undertreatment can have
dire consequences. If doctors can
determine whether their patients
are genetically predisposed to
developing cardiac fibrosis, they
can take much of the guesswork
out of treating them, and improve
long-term outcomes.
Ashley Kennedy ’16G, a stu-dent
in PSU’s Master of Science
in Biology program, believes that
day isn’t far off. With advances in
research, she says, “Medicine is
becoming more individualized.
We’re starting to sequence cancer
patients’ genomes to figure out
what treatments are going to be
most effective for them. And that’s
what we’re working toward for
people with cardiac fibrosis.”
In the Molecular Genetics Lab
in Boyd Science Center, Kennedy
and her colleagues—a mix of
ambitious graduate and under-graduate
biology students—have
homed in on a particular gene
called Connective Tissue Growth

¡Bienvenidos a
Cuba!
POLITICAL SCIENCE
PROFESSOR FILIZ
OTUCU RUHM always
dreamed of going to Cuba. In fact,
she planned on visiting the island
more than a decade ago. “The
social scientist in me wanted to
observe Castro’s Cuba, then go
back after Castro, and experience
the changes,” she says.
Fidel Castro’s Cuba was marked
by a boost in the nation’s literacy
rates and the establishment of
national health care and education
programs, which elevated the
Communist dictator to hero status
in many Cubans’ eyes. At the same
time, his nearly 50-year reign was
also marked by human rights
abuses, an antagonistic relation-ship
with the US, and an economy
that was heavily dependent on the
former Soviet Union.
As it turned out, Ruhm didn’t
get to see Castro’s Cuba. A native
of Istanbul, Turkey, Ruhm earned
her master’s and doctoral degrees
in the US, and was looking to
become a US citizen. Because rela-tions
between the US and Cuba
were strained, she says, “I didn’t
want the trip to create a problem
for me when I applied for US
citizenship, so I chose not to go.”
Ruhm’s dream to finally
experience Cuba came within
reach in December 2014, when
US President Barack Obama and
Cuban President Raul Castro,
Fidel’s younger brother, agreed
to restore ties between their
respective countries after five
decades of conflict. In the wake
of that agreement, the US eased
restrictions on travel to Cuba,
and Ruhm decided to combine
her longtime personal goal with
an unprecedented educational
opportunity for PSU students.
Ruhm designed a travel-study
course for Winterim 2016, Access
Cuba: History, Culture, and
Environmental Sustainability. The
course offered a one-credit option,
in which students journaled
about their experiences, and a
three-credit option that combined
journaling with a research project.
Daniel Spearman ’17, a political
science major with a double
minor in biology and peace and
social justice, was one of the first
students to sign up. “It was an
incredible opportunity to visit
a country that most Americans
have been restricted from for
decades,” he says. He also knew
it would give him invaluable
experience for the career in
international relations he hopes
to have after college.

On January 3, 2016, Ruhm and a
group of 10 excited and adventur-ous
students flew out of Boston
Logan International Airport
for Miami, then on to Havana.
During their 10 days on the island,
Ruhm and her students explored
Havana Vieja (Old Havana),
visited the Museum of the Revo-lution,
toured coffee and tobacco
farms, learned about alternative
energy and agriculture in Cuba,
and immersed themselves in
vibrant Cuban culture.
Here are just some of the
things the group discovered
during their visit:
Cuba’s hospitality industry
is … evolving.
Ruhm and her students knew
that entering Cuba would be
like going back in time: Internet
access and cell phone service were
cost-prohibitive, and they’d have
to operate on a cash-only basis
since their credits cards would
not be accepted.
What they hadn’t realized was,
just because the US eased travel
restrictions doesn’t mean that
Cuba is ready for the flood of eager
tourists that is now coming in as a
result. “The Cuban tourist industry
is overwhelmed,” says Ruhm.
“We found that out right
away, from the time we landed at
Havana Airport,” Spearman notes.
“We waited on the tarmac for an
hour because they only had one
staircase. We later learned that the
airport typically sees an average of
only 20 planes a week. Six of them
came in the day we landed.”
Ruhm and her students also
learned that Cuban accommoda-tions
are woefully outdated. The
Havana-based hotel they booked
prior to the trip ended up not
having enough rooms when they
arrived, so the road-weary group
had to scramble for lodgings on
their first night in Cuba.
Over the course of their 10-day
stay, they changed hotels 7 times
due to everything from faulty
lighting to flooding bathrooms.
“One of the places we stayed was
ranked only two stars, but it
turned out to be one of the best
hotels we stayed at during the
trip,” says Spearman.
Cubans excel at living
sustainably because they
have had no choice.
The collapse of the Soviet Union
in 1991 had a profound impact
on Cuba, which for decades
depended on the Soviets for
necessities such as food, clothing,
and fuel. Throughout the 90s,
Cuba struggled to become more
self-reliant and in the process
adopted a bicycle culture, devel-oped
urban organic farming
practices, and launched refor-estation
efforts. These initiatives
were so successful that in 2006,
the World Wildlife Fund cited
Cuba as the only sustainable
country in the world. The country
continues to be viewed as a model
of sustainability.
Even with its model organic
farming practices in place, the
island still must import about 80
percent of its food, which is then
rationed. “Each month, Cubans
get ration cards that they fill out
when they go to the grocery store,”
Spearman says, noting that the
typical Cuban diet consists largely
of rice and beans, which are cheap
and plentiful. “We ate the same
thing for lunch and dinner every
day—black beans, rice, chicken
or pork, shredded cabbage, and a
fruit, usually papaya.”
Access to fresh water is also
a challenge. Cuba’s economic
decline, along with the country’s
severe drought, has deteriorated
water supplies and sanitation
services. “Water is a huge issue
in Cuba,” says Ruhm. “They need
to recycle their water; they can’t
afford to waste it.”
“There is no excess in Cuba; the
supply isn’t big enough for excess,”
says Spearman, who was so struck
by Cuba’s sustainability efforts and
the impetus behind them that he
changed his research focus from
healthcare to sustainability.
Cuba has a dual
currency system.
While in Cuba, Ruhm and her
students learned about Cuba’s
peculiar currency system: there’s
the peso that Cubans use (also
referred to as the “national coin”),
and then there’s the convertible
peso (or CUCs, pronounced
“kooks”) that tourists use, which is
worth much more. “What a tour-ist
spends in a day, a Cuban would
spend in a month,” notes Ruhm.
“Leaving one CUC as a tip to
housekeeping is huge,” says Spear-man,
“considering they only make
20 CUCs a month.”
To make matters worse, while
the average Cuban worker earns
his or her wages in pesos, goods are
priced in CUCs, making most foods
and household items unaffordable.
As a social scientist and edu-cator,
Ruhm is deeply concerned
about how the burgeoning
tourist industry will shape Cuban
values in the coming years. “Until

University?” t-shirts. Photo courtesy

recently, Cubans were very
focused on education,” she says.
“Because it’s free, many Cubans
hold master’s degrees and PhDs.
But now, in an economy where
a taxi driver or housekeeper can
make more than a surgeon or an
engineer, where’s the incentive to
get an education?”
Cubans want good
relations with us, but they
don’t want to be us.
Ruhm and her students did more
than just observe life in Cuba,
they made a point to connect
with its people. “The goal of this
trip was to immerse ourselves
in Cuban society, to get to know
people from all walks of life:
teachers, artists, activists, health-care
workers,” she says.
What Ruhm and her students
found was, even with few
resources and little money, the
Cuban people they encountered
were happy and lively—the oppo-site
of the stereotypes that took
root in the Cold War era. “We
have this view of socialist societ-ies
as being grim and depressing,”
Ruhm says, “but Cubans don’t feel
oppressed, they feel free.”
And while many Cubans are
hopeful for a better relationship
with the US, they’re not looking
to adopt the American way of
life. “They don’t want their lives
to change; they sincerely believe
in the benefits of socialism—free
health care, free education,” says
Ruhm. “They want to keep that
sense of security that, in the future,
they know they’ll be taken care of.”
Claira’s Guide
to Cuba
PSU alumna and world traveler Claira
Monier ’62 went to Cuba with an
educational tour group in February
2014.“It was on my bucket list,” she says
of her three-week trip. “Cuba is an island
captured in time. It hasn’t been gentrified
like other Caribbean islands.”
Like Professor Filiz Otucu Ruhm and her students, Monier discovered
that the Cuban people are friendly, every hotel presents a different
set of challenges, and the island is on the verge of big change in the
wake of thawing relations with the US. She too would love to return in
a few years, though she laments that “it won’t be the Cuba I saw.”
Here are some of her recommendations for what to see and do
in Cuba:
VISIT Hemingway’s House in San Francisco de Paula. “It’s
been so well-preserved, it’s as if he just left it. His books, his
furniture, and his boat are all still there,” says Monier.
EAT Want an authentic Cuban dining experience? Eat
at a paladar, a family-run restaurant in a private home.
“Everywhere we went it was rice and beans and chicken—
every meal,” says Monier. “The food may not have variety,
but it’s absolutely delicious.”
DRINK Wind down after a day of sightseeing with a
Hemingway-inspired daiquiri or mojito at one of his favorite
bars, La Bodeguita Del Medio in Havana.
STAY Spend at least one night at the historic Hotel
Nationale, which was built in 1930 and has hosted everyone
from Winston Churchill to Frank Sinatra. It has retained its art
deco design and is “absolutely fabulous,” says Monier.
SEE Cuba’s history: The Che Guevara Monument in Santa
Clara and the Plaza de la Revolución (Revolution Square) are
must-sees in Havana, and take in a rodeo at the King Ranch in
Nuevitas, just for fun.
Claira Pirozzi Monier ’62 completed the second of her two
four-year terms on the PSUAA board of directors in 2015,
serves on the reunion committee for her class, and is a member
of PSU’s Heritage Society.
“They’re also proud of their
culture and history,” adds Spear-man.
When it comes to historical
events like the US embargo, the
Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the
Cuban Missile Crisis—events that
destroyed relations between the
two countries for half a century—
the people he met “were able to
separate the past from the present,
and Americans from American
foreign policy,” he says.
Ten days isn’t nearly enough
time to get to know this
beautiful and complex country.
Both Ruhm and Spearman would
love to return to Cuba someday.
“I’d like to stay in Cuba longer,
talk with more people, and get
their take on what’s happening
to their country,” says Spearman.
In the meantime, he’s putting the
finishing touches on his research
project and preparing to do an
internship this summer with the
United Nations. “Traveling to
Cuba has shown me there’s so
much more I want to learn and
experience in the world,” he says.
Ruhm is thrilled to finally have
had the opportunity to see Cuba
and explore it with her students.
Her one regret, she says, “is not
getting to Cuba earlier.” It’s been
just over a year since Americans
have been able to visit Cuba with
fewer restrictions, and in that
time, the island has changed.
“The change has been dramatic,”
she says, “and it looks like it will
continue to be that way.”

TODAY’S DONORS WANT—AND CAN FIND—more information about the causes and
organizations they support. They want to feel confident that their gift is going to make a
difference; and with the help of online reviews, neutral information services like Guide-
Star and Charity Navigator, and watchdog reporters like CharityWatch, useful information is
more readily available than ever before. If a nonprofit is not stewarding the gifts it receives in the
most effective and responsible way possible, donors will know—and they might not be willing to
commit their energy and resources to that organization.
A New Day,
A New Way
0f Giving
Thanks to life in the digital age, when
information is as close as a swipe and a
tap away, old-school philanthropy has
been turned on its head.
■ by Emilie Coulter
12 Plymouth Magazine | Spring 2016
Influenced in part by the Millennial
generation, donors of all ages and stages have
begun to think of philanthropy as more of an
investment than simply a gift. And they seek
a social return on this investment. They want
tools to measure the environmental, social,
and financial impact of giving. As the younger
generation brings its zeal for metrics to giving,
making social and fiscal impact is becoming
ever more important to all donors.
Once today’s philanthropists have done
their research and are fully committed to a
cause, they often want to roll up their sleeves
and work side by side with the members of
their chosen organization. For many donors
now, it’s not enough to simply write a check.
Philanthropists like John D. ’85 and Carrie
Morgridge believe that solutions to social
problems come from active engagement with
people on the frontlines. They’re seeing the
value of contributing their own knowledge,
expertise, and relationships to the organiza-tions
they support. They want to be active
partners, not passive funders. “I gained a tre-mendous
amount of growth and skills here at
Plymouth State,” John says, “and I want to give
back to the community that supported me and
helped me grow up.”
For the Morgridges, supporting educa-tion—
in particular, innovative advances in
education—has always been a top priority.
Virtually everything they do as philanthropists
is influenced by their desire to help students
of all ages be prepared to meet the demands
of a twenty-first century workforce. Whether
they’re investing in teacher training and
technology for public school districts or
backing programs that teach elementary
schoolchildren problem-solving skills and
entrepreneurship in addition to science, tech-nology,
engineering, and math, the Morgridge
Family Foundation makes accessible learning
its focus.
As Plymouth State aims to improve
public higher education through the
development of interdisciplinary initiatives,
learning laboratories, and partnerships with
the community, the Morgridges have been
For many donors now,

paying attention. And, true to nature, they
have gotten involved. Their commitment to
supporting John’s alma mater as it pioneers
changes in education has resulted in a part-nership
that is allowing students to emerge
from PSU not as strangers to the real world,
but as welcome, familiar friends.
THE CIRCLE OF PHILANTHROPY
The Morgridges are also passionate about
supporting people of all ages in giving back to
their community in any way they can. They
understand that the new way of giving has
become a meaningful part of many young
people’s lives while they’re still building their
careers—or even while they’re still in school.
“Philanthropy can start at a very young age,”
says John. And gifts don’t have to be huge
to make a huge impact. Even major donors
today are realizing the value of committing
to smaller, less expensive projects that add up
to real change. “Sometimes, fifty dollars can
change a life,” Carrie says.
They should know. The Morgridge Family
Opportunity Scholarship was established at
Plymouth State in 2004 to reduce the poten-tial
debt burdens of first-generation college
students. It has provided scholarships for
40 students thus far. The following year, the
Morgridges selected PSU for the first college
chapter of their youth philanthropy club, the
Student Support Foundation (SSF). The SSF’s
mission is to keep students in school and to
create a culture of philanthropy in the cam-pus
community.
What makes the SSF special as a granting
body is that the grantors are all students
learning how to give. Each year, the Morgridge
Family Foundation gives the SSF $4,000 to
make grants in the club’s established funding
priorities. At PSU, that includes emergency
assistance grants to individual students for
things like medical expenses, textbooks, and
gas money. Student members determine how
the money will be allocated, raise additional
funds, and oversee the operation of an
“Fifty dollars can change
a life.”–Carrie Morgridge

on-campus food pantry. At the end of each
school year, members submit an annual report,
detailing grants, budgets, and success stories.
By reviewing applications and awarding grants
to students in need, members of the SSF learn
the life skills of service and philanthropy.
“They come to realize that a very small
donation to a fellow student for reading
glasses, or a few dollars for gas to take advan-tage
of an internship, can make a real impact,”
John says. It’s not uncommon for members of
the SSF board of directors to be former recip-ients
of SSF grants themselves, motivated to
give back after experiencing the impact of a
small gift at the right moment. Others join
with noble but fuzzy ideas of contributing
to the betterment of the world, but end up
receiving something more valuable than
they ever imagined, which is just what the
Morgridges hoped for when they introduced
the Student Support Foundation to Plymouth
State. Service clubs like the SSF encourage
students to develop, express, and sustain
positive social identities as helpful and com-passionate
members of the community.
For Adam Murata ’16, joining the SSF had
personal significance. “I know there’s a lot of
need out there. In fact, there have been several
times in my life when I could have used some-thing
like the food pantry,” he says. “Having
been in that situation myself, I felt like this
was a good opportunity to try and help people

and compassionate members of the community.
out, as well as meet good people that want to
do like work.”
When Courtney Bracken ’16 began
volunteering at the SSF food pantry she was
not aware of the extent of student need on
campus. “I assumed everyone had the meal
plan, but that’s not the case,” she says. “People
started coming for food during my volunteer
hours and it really opened my eyes.” Since
then, Bracken, who now serves as Student
Support Foundation secretary and food
pantry manager, has been involved in the
Morgridge Family Foundation’s Dream Big
project celebrating the SSF’s 10th anniversary
on the PSU campus: moving the pantry to
a bigger, more welcoming location. After

almost a year of hard work by SSF members—
writing grants, spiffing up the space, and
finally moving this past fall—the new food
pantry is up and running with more visitors
than ever, Bracken says.
FUELING THE PASSION
Plymouth State is not alone among state
universities witnessing—and adapting to—the
philanthropical paradigm shift in recent
decades. Friends and benefactors like John and
Carrie Morgridge are now inspiring donors
to emerge from the background and get
into the clubs and classrooms of causes they
support. As John says, “We encourage people
to find their passion because fulfillment is
what motivates you to give more. We need that
reinforcement for our heart and our soul.”
As for John and Carrie, nothing makes
them happier than to be part of this circle of
giving. “We feel very fortunate to give students
an opportunity to support their community,
an opportunity they might not have known
they had,” John says. “Students feel the same
way we do when we’re philanthropic: It feels
like you’re making a difference as a human in
this world.” ■

BY MOST MEASURES, COLIN GRAHAM
’01 IS A SUCCESS. But giving back to his
alma mater, including the endowment of
a university scholarship, provides an opportunity
to display the type of leadership that defines him
best. Graham counts success as finding whatever
feeds one’s heart and soul, and he’s cultivated a
rewarding career by helping others do just that.
Graham earned a business management
degree from Plymouth State in 2001 and is a
partner and head of the Industrial Practice at RSR
Partners, a global executive search and leadership
consulting firm. “I have had the good fortune of
being a client of Colin’s for years,” says Tony Guzzi, CEO of EMCOR
Group, a Fortune 500 construction company. “What strikes me most
about him is his never-ending drive to give back. It is no surprise to me
that he is now giving back to the school that he loves.” Graham’s spirit
of generosity has elevated his business relationships beyond the quality
of his work product.
In recognition of the high-quality education that made his career
possible, Graham established the Colin S. Graham ’01 Business Lead-ership
Scholarship. “Although some would equate success with money
or power, what really matters to me is servant leadership,” Graham says,
referring to the philosophy that puts service first. “Establishing this
scholarship, and seeing the resulting impact for a recipient student, is its
own reward.”
Graham’s first scholarship recipient, Erik Strom, will earn his under-graduate
degree in finance next year thanks to Graham’s assistance and
mentorship. In addition to the generous scholarship, Graham helped
Strom secure a summer internship at Bank of America in New York City.
Strom, a Gothenburg, Sweden, native with a 3.96 GPA, is elated by Gra-ham’s
generosity and has enjoyed the lessons gleaned from his mentor.
“This internship is such a great opportunity,” Strom says. “And Colin
is so inspiring. He’s always providing great advice and mentoring. I’m
funding my education through student loans, so this scholarship means
the world to me.”
“It has been an incredible experience to support a future leader
like Erik and see the difference the scholarship is making in his life,”
Graham says.
Graham is familiar with Strom’s path. He worked multiple jobs to pay
his way through college before becoming a leading advisor to some of
the world’s top corporations. He attributes that ascent to principles he
developed while in college. “My Plymouth State experience reinforced
the value of a strong work ethic and it’s been my privilege to give back.”

	 Four Coconuts
and a Dream:
Life at Sea with Toutou ’98 and David Marsden ’97
Spearfishing in the Bahamas. Dodging midnight
lightning in Panama. Raking coffee beans in Costa
Rica. Toutou ’98 and David Marsden ’97 are living a
life that most only dream about. Leaving behind their
house, car, and possessions in 2014, the couple set sail
from Hilton Head, South Carolina, with their two young
children, and have since had amazing experiences across
23 countries on a catamaran called Four Coconuts.
Both Toutou and David caught the travel bug early on.
Toutou spent her junior year as a marketing major studying in
Thailand, followed by a whirlwind four-month backpacking trip
around Asia. When she came home, travel had become an indel-ible
part of her. “I made a promise to myself it was something I’d
keep doing,” she says.
David’s wanderlust began even earlier, on childhood vacations
in the Caribbean. Walking the docks, his family would admire
boats and point out the ports of call listed on the stern of each,
imagining the adventures and exotic locations each vessel had
visited. David discovered that life at sea was a real possibility.
After 17 years spent living, working, and starting a family in the
Boston region, David and Toutou began to experience that
familiar itch to travel. Hearing about a couple who had moved to
Costa Rica to run a bed and breakfast sparked the idea of start-ing
their own unconventional lifestyle. They began planning in
earnest for their family sailing adventure.
Four Coconuts: Setting Sail
It took four years of saving, preparation, and countless hours
spent devouring every scrap of information they could about
sailing. Most of their friends and family were supportive, but
they had plenty of questions about life on the water. What
would they do about hurricanes? How would they eat?
As Toutou says, pursuing a life of freedom and passion is some-thing
many people want to do, but it’s easy to let uncertainty,
obligations, and fear become excuses not to take action. The
Marsden family decided they simply had to grab their courage,
set a date, and go.
Toutou says one of the most gratifying aspects of preparing for
the sailing trip was helping ignite the fire for others to go after
their goals. The message they’re sharing now is that anyone can
do the same. It’s all about realizing you can do something differ-ent
and then moving forward, even if the unknown seems scary.
And there have been scary moments. Early in the voyage, the
Marsdens were surrounded by three ominous water spouts.
Other times they witnessed lightning strikes that were a bit too
close for comfort. But these brief adrenaline-pumping incidents

to grab their courage, set a date, and go.

are balanced out by the many sweet moments. Discovering a
secluded hot spring in the rainforest and sharing its welcom-ing
warmth with friends. Lying on the Four Coconuts deck as a
family and counting the shooting stars overhead. These magical
times are what make the Marsdens’ experience worth it.
Full Memories
“We grew up thinking that we had to work until we’re 60, retire,
and move to Florida,” David says. But as they’ve pursued their
goal, they’ve met more and more people living alternative life-styles
and doing just fine. “We can have comforts without the
traditional corporate job,” he says. “We’re far more laid back
than when we left. We feel lighter with less stuff, more nimble.”
They grew accustomed to a simpler lifestyle, one with nature
playing a major role in their daily experience. On the boat, they
relied on solar energy and wind to power them, and were con-scious
of using less water. This is a way of resourceful living
they’ve grown to love. Toutou says, “A full entry in our travel
blog is better than 50 different types of toys. Full closets mean
less to us than full memories.”
A Hands-on, Real-world Education
Meeting and interacting with people from across the globe,
the Marsden children have learned about how others live, and
shared their own experiences in presentations to travelers and
friends. “Our kids have become vertically socialized,” David
says, and are very comfortable with all ages, cultures, and back-grounds.
Unlike many their age, Maya and Tyler are not inundat-ed
with TV and digital media, but instead have grown in their
own communication skills. When they meet with other cruisers,
David says, they can be found happily discussing dinghy
engines, weather, current events, and even the merits of various
anchorages.
“We wanted to go when the kids were young,” David says, at
that perfect age when the “kids are still involved with us and us
with them. These are their formative years; we can really start
shaping who they will become.”
New Adventures on the Horizon
But all good things must come to an end. In March the Mars-den
family docked in the Palm Beach area and began making
preparations to sell their beloved catamaran so they can set out
on their next adventure. As spring stretches into summer, Tout-ou,
David, and the kids will hop in a different kind of vehicle—a
car!—and spend several months heading west on a grand road
trip. They want to explore national parks, major cities, and catch
up with other sailing friends they met out on the water.
Wherever this family travels, their time at sea will always be a
part of them. On a recent car trip, shortly after coming ashore
in Florida, the kids reacted with amazement at the speed of the
vehicle.
Tyler, ever the sailor, exclaimed, “we must be going at least 90
knots!” ■ Amy Dresser Hartle ’10

Scotland to Australia to Morocco. The Marsdens’ story inspired them, and reminds
them that a life of travel can be possible even as they grow their own family.

Plymouth State University’s new integrated clusters model offers a host of benefits to current and incoming students seek-ing
real-world opportunities to apply their knowledge while accruing foundational skills. But what of alumni, donors and
members of the surrounding community who wish to participate in this groundbreaking initiative; are there ways for you
to engage as well? In a word, yes—there are many avenues to participation, as the following initiatives demonstrate.
RECONNECTING TO THE PAST, CONTRIBUTING
TO THE FUTURE: CLASSES OF 1975 AND 1976
GREENWAY
Plymouth State’s Greenway is one of the most heavily
trafficked sections of the campus, a beautiful allée that wel-comes
visitors, current and prospective students to campus
and leads to The Center for Active Living, Learning and
Wellness (ALLWell North) and PE Center.
Hundreds, if not thousands, pass by the Greenway daily,
a fact that convinced alumni from the Classes of 1975 and
1976 that this site was the ideal place to place a permanent
marker celebrating their time at Plymouth State and estab-lishing
their commitment to the health and well-being of
all who pass this way in years to come.
The project also allows class members to contribute to
an integrated cluster—in this case that of Health &amp; Human
Enrichment—through investment in a capital project that
directly benefits the cluster.
The idea grew out of conversations held at the classes’
39th and 40th class reunions. During that Homecoming
Weekend and in the months after, old friendships were
rekindled and members of the two classes realized they
wanted to do something to leave a legacy for current and
future PSU students. “The Greenway naming project gives
our classes the opportunity to leave a permanent marker
on campus that commemorates and celebrates our experi-ence
at PSC/PSU, while also allowing us to reconnect with
the campus and underscore the importance of giving back,”
says project co-organizer Scott Biederman ’75.
Biederman is spearheading the campaign—whose
tagline is “Let’s do this!”—with his wife Patti Ryan
Innovative. Different.
BOLD. Hands-on education in clusters
Biederman ’76, Dianne Lutz Rappa ’76 and Diane Tillotson
Tiffany ’76. The foursome has set a preliminary fundraising
goal of $100,000 for the project, which will be used to
engrave a stone bench marker with the inscription “Classes
of 1975 and 1976 Greenway.” The total gift of $250,000 is the
goal for 2020; these funds will be used to support current
and future programs at the ALLWell Complex. “This is not
so much about giving back to the University as it is build-ing
for the future,” observes Rappa.
The ALLWell Complex is an important locus on
campus and the ALLWell North building, which opened
in November 2015, has further enhanced the area. The
107,600 square-foot building is a point of pride in
Plymouth and Holderness, offering new academic, athletic
and recreation space to the campus and the community.
ALLWell North provides a host of benefits: enabling
enhanced offerings for Health and Human Performance
majors and minors—the university’s third largest major;
creating a beautiful Outdoor Center with programs
and equipment available to all students; offering a new
fieldhouse that serves as the largest capacity venue north
of Manchester; opening new avenues for economic
development in Plymouth and Holderness through visitor
spending; and significantly improving athletic and rec-reational
opportunities for both campus and community
members. “ALLWell North is visible, viable and important
for our state and for the North Country,” asserts Rappa.
“I think it’s important for current and prospective
students to see that, 40 years out, alumni are still involved
with the campus and giving back,” says Tiffany. “It sends a
powerful message about our belief in the institution.”

“Competition for students among colleges and uni-versities
is very strong these days, and we want to let our
classmates know what’s happening at Plymouth State
now and what’s coming in the future. The University’s
new integrated clusters model not only offers kids the
opportunity to get an education, but also allows them to
graduate with the ability to get a job, which is very power-ful,”
Scott Biederman concludes. “We want alums to come
back to campus and see how pretty it is, and we want to
keep students in the state after they graduate. The ALLWell
Complex plays an important role in the life of the campus
and community and we’re happy to support it.”
Class members plan to unveil the Greenway marker on
September 23, 2017, during Homecoming weekend. “I’m
confident we’ll make the goal—there’s strength in numbers,”
says Biederman.
Those wishing to make a gift or bequest (a gift can be
pledged over three years) are encouraged to call John
Scheinman, director of Development and Major Gifts, at

VISUALIZING SCIENCE: MUSEUM OF THE WHITE
MOUNTAINS EXHIBITION GIVES FORM TO DATA
The title of the Museum of the White Mountains’ (MWM)
recent exhibition, Forecasting: Climate Change and Water
Impact, suggested a rather technical installation, but
those expecting to be met with dry charts and graphs got
a surprise: the exhibition was not only informative, but
also beautiful. It also provided a stunning illustration of
the inherent strength of Plymouth State’s new integrated
clusters model—focusing, in this instance, on the cluster
of Tourism, Environment &amp; Sustainable Development—
by drawing faculty, students, alumni and community
members together to address the real-world dilemma of
climate change.
Uniting the disciplines of meteorology, technology and
visual art, ‘Forecasting’ explored the topic of climate change
and its impact on water. Artists and scientists from across
the region joined forces to create works coupling contem-porary
art with scientific data on the oceans of the world,
waterways, atmosphere and drought, all with the goal of
deepening visitors’ understanding how climate change
impacts individuals.
An area of particular focus for the exhibit was the
Mount Washington Boundary Layer Exposure Project
which Eric Kelsey, PSU research assistant professor and
director of research at Mount Washington Observatory,
suggested would lend itself to artistic interpretation.

donation of the Classes

In September of 2016, after preliminary discussions
with participating artists Shandra ‘Shani’ McLane ’09G
and Kimberly Ritchie, who co-curated the exhibition with
MWM Director Cynthia Robinson, Kelsey invited the
artists to join him and a group of six students collecting
data on the mountain. “We spent the day releasing weather
balloons and driving a water vapor stable isotope analyzer
up and down the Auto Road in the passenger seat of a
pick-up truck,” says Kelsey. “The data we collected revealed
a lot about how the boundary layer evolves during the day.”
“It was a fascinating day,” agrees Ritchie. “Shani and I
talked to the scientists and students and experienced the
research in progress, all of which gave us some great ideas
for visually displaying the study findings.”
PSU alumna and glass artist McLane relies heavily on
science to produce her work and asserts that presenting
new ideas in aesthetically pleasing ways can provoke
dialogue. She is also interested in environmental issues, so
an exhibition designed to present climate science to a larger
audience in a fresh way was incredibly appealing, as was
the group dynamic that defined the project. “One of my
favorite things is collaboration—it transforms my work,”
says McLane. “Working on this exhibition was wonderful;
we all contributed something and our individual insights
came together seamlessly.”
Ritchie, an assistant professor of art at PSU and coor-dinator
of the University’s printmaking program, was
similarly enthusiastic. “I’m very interested in the role of
art in science as well as the role of science in art,” she says.
“Science provides a platform for me to build on and I help
scientists by making hard facts and data more visually
accessible.”
For atmospheric scientist Eric Kelsey, the project rep-resented
an opportunity to express his research findings
in a new way. Kelsey’s sketch of his initial experimental
findings—a visualization of the way air moves around the
mountain—was included in a multimedia piece created
by McLane and Ritchie. Although he’s not accustomed to
presenting his findings through art, Kelsey learned how
art can bring scientific results to a much broader audience,
“Science provides a platform for me to
build on and I help scientists by making
hard facts and data more visually
accessible.” —Kimberly Ritchie

thus increasing the impact of his research. In addition, says
Kelsey, communicating science through art is very much
in keeping with current scientific trends. “The National
Science Foundation is keen on having artists involved
in communicating scientific knowledge to the public.
Participating in this exhibition was the first time I’d done
something like this, but I hope this is just the first phase of
a larger science/art collaboration on this project.”
“Forecasting” was on view at MWM from January 23
through April 21, 2017.

ANN HAGGART: A LIFELONG EDUCATOR LEAVES
$1.5 MILLION BEQUEST
Ann Haggart’s recent gift of nearly $1.5 million to Plymouth
State University—one of the four largest gifts the institu-tion
has ever received—was undeniably generous, but to
those who knew her, it was hardly surprising: a commit-ment
to education was part of Haggart’s DNA.
A lifelong educator, Haggart was also a descendant of
Colonel Samuel Holmes, who in 1808 gave $500 to create a
teacher’s preparatory school, Holmes Plymouth Academy,
the predecessor of Plymouth State University. Haggart
picked up the baton for her generation, committing her life
to serving disenfranchised children through her company
AGH Associates, Inc., which provided training and therapy
in public schools and child care centers across the nation.
Prior to her death in February of this year, Haggart under-scored
her faith in the power of education once more.
Haggart requested that her bequest be split to serve two
purposes. One portion will provide scholarships to New
Hampshire students with documented financial needs,
with priority given to those hailing from Coös, Grafton
and Carroll counties. “Approximately 40 percent of our stu-dents
represent the first generation in their family to attend
college,” notes Vice President for University Advancement
Paula Lee Hobson, “and Ann realized how vital scholarship
support often is to this segment of our student body.”
The other 50 percent of Haggart’s gift will be used
to create the Holmes-Pattee-Haggart Transformational
Leadership Institute, an initiative that will focus on K–12
leaders and their connection with community leaders. “Ann
saw the potential in our new integrated clusters model and
immediately recognized an opportunity to support expe-riential
learning experiences for K–12 leaders through an
open laboratory here at PSU,” explains Hobson.
Haggart knew that K–12 administrators were eager for
hands-on experience in continuing education, explains
Hobson, and envisioned a program in which these individ-uals
could work side-by-side with leaders from across the
state to bolster their skills.
Indeed, Haggart’s concept dovetails beautifully with the
aims of PSU’s new clusters: Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship
and Education, Democracy and Social Change.“We’re
heartened by Ann’s foresight and belief in the University’s
new approach to education,” says Hobson. “Her generous
gift represents a huge investment in the integrated clusters
model as well as a major boost for student scholarships.”

in a number of ways, including
higher GPAs and retention rates.
Currently, 56 percent of our
students live on campus. Research
consistently demonstrates that
The residential, community-ori-ented

to open this fall with a goal of cre-ating
a tourism infrastructure and
positive economic impact in three
to five years.

WHEN ALUMNA KIM
BOWNES ’07G was
named Director of
Athletics in January, she added
another crack to a glass ceiling in
collegiate athletics. She joined the
group of women leading National
Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) Division III athletics
departments who make up just 29
percent of DIII athletics directors,
according to the 2016 report by
the NCAA’s Division III Diversity
and Inclusion Working Group.
Bownes is Plymouth State
University’s first female to hold the
director of athletics post among the
11 who have served since the posi-tion
was created in 1950. For nearly
fifty years prior to the formalization
of athletics administration,
women on campus had competed
in a wide variety of intramural
and recreational sports. Yet it
wasn’t until 1960 that Plymouth
State’s first women’s intercollegiate
athletic team, field hockey, was
established. Now, Bownes over-sees
13 intercollegiate women’s
teams and 11 men’s involving
more than 600 student athletes.
Assisting Bownes is an admin-istrative
team of three, two of
whom are women and alumnae:
Associate Director Courtney
O’Clair ’04, ’08G, Assistant
Director Lauren Lavigne ’94, ’96G,
and Assistant Director /Head
Athletic Trainer Mark Legacy. Her
team reflects another important
finding of the DIII Diversity and
Inclusion Working Group in 2016:
women hold almost 50 percent
of associate director of athletics
positions indicating a strong
pipeline toward the top athletics
leadership position. O’Clair par-ticipated
in an NCAA internship
Kim Bownes ’07G: Cracking the Glass Ceiling in
Athletics Administration
in 2006–08 specifically designed
to promote women and minori-ties
in athletics administration.
“Plymouth State University has
always been supportive of women
administrators, and that has car-ried
through to athletics,” Bownes
said. “Our role is as mentors to
all student-athletes, but I think
it really helps our young women
see that they can advance toward
positions of leadership in what-ever
field they choose. I believe it
also helps our young men; it can
prepare them for their future by
learning to interact with women
in positions of authority.”
Bownes sees herself as part of
the movement that is breaking
the glass ceiling for women in
collegiate athletics. “The Little
East Conference has seen a big
change in the leadership level,”
she explained. “Just a couple
of years ago, seven of the eight
member schools had male athletic
directors. Today, five of the eight
have female athletic directors.”
She quickly added, “There is still a
shortage of women in higher level
athletic administration roles. Divi-sion
III has a higher percentage of
women than Division I, but both
are still very male dominated.”
Being qualified for the top job
is not an issue. A native Canadian
who holds a bachelor’s degree in
education from McGill University
in Montreal, Bownes earned the
master of education degree with a
concentration in athletic admin-istration
from Plymouth State in
2007. The following year she was
named associate director of ath-letics
and closed an extraordinary
chapter as a coach.
Bownes had come to Plymouth
State in 1987 when named head
men’s and women’s alpine ski
coach. Her talent and commit-ment
to excellence was evidenced
by the PSU Women’s and Men’s
Ski Teams’ qualification for the
United States Collegiate Ski and
Snowboard Association (USCSA)
National Championships in all
but one of the 21 years she served
as coach. The Panther ski teams
won numerous Eastern Regional
Championships during her tenure
as well.
The new director of athletics
follows double-alumnus John P.
Clark ’71, ’73G who served in the
role twice totaling nearly 20 of his
45-year career at Plymouth State.
In Clark’s oversight of the depart-ment,
women’s involvement in
athletics expanded significantly
with the addition of varsity pro-grams
in swimming and diving,
volleyball, ice hockey, and cross
country/track and field. For his
advocacy and contributions to the
advancement of women’s issues,
Clark was honored with the Theo
Kalikow Award in 2009. Bownes
was also recognized with the
Kalikow Award in 2014.

Seeing Further:
Into the North Country
8 Plymouth Magazine | Spring 2017
THE LANCASTER PROJECT, an
integrated cluster initiative that uses
a multidisciplinary approach, focuses
on bringing more life to the small business
community on Main Street, particularly the
historical Lancaster National Bank building, in
Lancaster, New Hampshire. The project capi-talizes
on the varied knowledge of 60 students
from 10 different academic majors. Collabora-tive
groups work on seven client-based teams,
primarily addressing cohesive, effective brand-ing
schemes for local businesses, events, and
the town of Lancaster itself. Teams also devise
strategies and comprehensive plans to attract
a younger demographic to New Hampshire’s
North Country, where the aging workforce
has caused economic strain on the area in
recent years.
Leading the initiative is PSU business
professor Roy Stever, along with fellow faculty
member Pamela Anneser, Eric Spieth of the
Plymouth Enterprise Center, and Lancaster
business leaders Peter Powell of Peter W. Pow-ell
Real Estate and Greg Cloutier of Lancaster
Main Street Buildings. Over the course of 16
weeks, students not only work on the project
from the classroom, but also visit the town
of Lancaster. The initiative provides students
with experiences that enhance their overall
education, and offer the fresh perspectives and
innovation of PSU faculty and students to the
Lancaster community.
“The Lancaster Initiative is a great expres-sion
of collaborative, applied learning in
action,” says Stever. “The aging workforce is
a statewide issue, but is particularly acute in
the North Country. Through the three areas of
this project, PSU students will explore ways in
which Lancaster can attract young profession-als
to live and work there. What better way to
engage students in the North Country than by
addressing this issue?”
As students and faculty apply the material
learned in class to a real-life setting, they
create positive connections between Plymouth
State and the surrounding communities.
Through its collaborative nature, the project
also provides the opportunity for students to
foster important professional relationships
with Lancaster locals, faculty, and other stu-dents
across academic disciplines.
“It is exciting to see Plymouth State imple-menting
the integrated cluster model, and
that it is reaching into the North Country,”
says Cathy Conway, vice president, economic
development, Northern Community Invest-ment
Corporation (NCIC) and Board of
Trustee member, University System of New
Hampshire. “Lancaster is located at the inter-section
of major north-south and east-west
routes, it is the county seat, and has many pos-itive
assets, including a fabulous downtown
area, but it needs to be a place where young
people and small businesses can thrive. The
PSU Lancaster initiative will engage students
with community partners to address chal-lenges
and create sustainable solutions—it is a
unique opportunity with great potential.”

In an ever-changing world,
successful teams COLLABORATE
and COMMUNICATE.
I was interviewed on Monday about the cluster
initiative for a new podcast focused on higher
education in general and Plymouth State
University in particular. I think the interview
went well but there was one question that kind
of caught me by surprise. I think my answer
was ok but in thinking about it afterward, I
wish I had added some things.
Ian Halter, the interviewer, asked me
whether clusters are being initiated at other uni-versities
and, if yes, how does PSU’s initiative
relate to those? My answer was that yes, there
are other universities who are using a cluster
idea to create opportunities for interdisciplinary
work on difficult problems… I said that other
cluster initiatives do not imagine the restructur-ing
of the entire institution. Instead, they focus
on groups of people coming together to work on
particular wicked problems….
…This is very different than PSU’s initiative
in that we are changing the entire structure
of the University so that everyone on campus
will somehow support and engage with at least
one cluster. As I said, this is an ok answer but
I think it doesn’t quite highlight the major dif-ference
in what we’re doing compared to other
institutions.
The focus of the cluster initiatives at other
institutions begins with the faculty and their
research interests… The cluster initiative at PSU
starts with a focus on students.President Birx
wrote a series of blog entries as we were begin-ning
to envision what the cluster initiative is all
about. According to the President, the major
impetus for reorganizing the University around
clusters is to improve the student educational
experience. Our goal is for students to be able
to integrate knowledge and to understand how
what they have learned can impact the world.
We want students to “own” their educational
experience and be fully engaged in seeking
and taking advantage of every opportunity. In
other words, the cluster initiative is really about
becoming more student-centered in everything
we do…

transformation and how it is a catalyst for
creativity and innovation across the University
and beyond.

Patricia Cantor and Mary Cornish are professors in the early child-hood
education program who for years have studied and presented on
the potential impact of screen media and technology on infants and
toddlers. The pair recently collaborated on a textbook on this topic,
published last fall. Techwise Infant and Toddler Teachers: Making Sense
of Screen Media for Children Under 3 serves as a guide for teachers and
caregivers on how to make sound decisions about screen media to opti-mize
the learning and healthy development of infants and toddlers.
Below, Cantor and Cornish share what they have learned through their
research on the so-called “Touchscreen Generation.”
playing, has negative implications
for babies’ language development
and social play.
Despite marketing claims that
screen media products can set
babies on the path to become little
Einsteins, the evidence is clear
that infants and toddlers are much
more likely to learn from real-life,
personal interactions than from
what they see on a screen. Infants
and toddlers have a harder time
processing two-dimensional
images, like those on a screen,
than the three-dimensional
images of real life. As noted in the
American Academy of Pediatrics
2016 statement on Media and
Young Minds, “Because of their
immature symbolic, memory,
and attentional skills, infants and
toddlers cannot learn from tra-ditional
digital media as they do
from interactions with caregivers.”
Guidelines
Given the lack of evidence for
any developmental benefit from
screen media use by children
under 2, as well as the research
suggesting some potential harm,
the American Academy of Pedi-atrics
(AAP) strongly discourages
screen media use by children
under 18 months (with the
exception of video chat) and rec-ommends
very limited exposure
for children from 18 to 24 months.
If very young children are
exposed to screen media, they
should not be left to use it by
themselves. Rather, a caring adult
should interact with the child
during the media encounter,
engaging the child in conver-sation,
helping the child make
connections to his or her own
experiences, and supporting
the child’s understanding of the
media content.
This is called “joint media
engagement,” and for joint media
engagement to be effective, it
must go beyond simply watching
a TV program or swiping through
an app together.
No Substitute for Nurturing
Children born since 2010, when
apps first came on the scene, have
been called the “touchscreen
generation.” But despite the
omnipresence of screen media in
their lives, infants and toddlers
today learn and grow in the same
way that generations before them
have. In order to thrive, they
need responsive interactions with
attentive adults, opportunities to
play, move, and explore with all
their senses, and rich experiences
with language—being read to,
sung to, and talked with. Infants
and toddlers learn in the context
of nurturing relationships with
caring adults. There is no app that
can substitute for that. ■
Is There an App for That?
Child development in a media-saturated world
Infants and toddlers are living in
a screen media-saturated world.
Every day, an ever-growing num-ber
of apps, TV shows, electronic
toys, and e-books are being
developed and marketed for the
entertainment and education of
children under age 3. Never before
have so many different kinds of
technology been available, and
never before have children from
birth to age 3 experienced screen
media to such a great extent.
Risks
The full impact of newer
technologies, such as apps and
e-books, on infants’ and toddlers’
learning and development is not
yet understood. But decades of
research about television and
videos have yielded evidence
suggesting that the use of screen
media by very young children is
associated with higher risks for
obesity, attention problems, sleep
deprivation, language delays, and
aggressive behavior. Even just
being exposed to “background
television,” or television on in
the same room where they are

FACULTY FORUM
A PLYMOUTH STATE
ALUMNUS who
majored in finance and
economics, Ryan Chadwick ’00
is an entrepreneur by trade and a
living example of the integrated
cluster model. After starting his
first solo-run business in his
college years—providing ice to
restaurants in the Nantucket area
during the busy summer sea-son—
he realized there was always
greater opportunity to make use
of his resources. When the trucks
weren’t delivering ice, they were
used for moving furniture, trans-porting
and installing artwork,
and delivering appliances for
local individuals and businesses.
Chadwick had found a way to
make a profit, turning idleness
into action.
Next, Chadwick set his sights
on an unlikely combination:
restaurants, reef diving, and envi-ronmental
preservation. In his
free time, Chadwick enjoys diving
and spearfishing in the Bahamas
where, about two years ago, he
noticed that the ecosystems of the
reefs he frequented were rapidly
declining due to an invasive
species: Lionfish. Because the
fish reproduce at an astronomical
rate and consume up to ten times
their weight in prey, Lionfish are
one of the most invasive species
to the reef habitats in Florida,
the Caribbean, and the Gulf of
Mexico. Chadwick’s knowledge
of the fish came at the same time
he was opening Norman’s Cay, a
Caribbean-style restaurant in New
York City. To save the reefs he
loved, he began to hunt Lionfish
and send the fish to his restaurant,
where customers enjoyed the
unique delicacy. Through the
Lionfish Mission, Chadwick uses
his restaurant dishes to educate
customers about the preservation
of reef ecosystems.
As customers began to rave
about the delicately flavored white
fish, a door opened for another
business venture. Customers loved
the Lionfish dishes so much that
they wanted to buy the fish and
cook it for themselves. Chadwick
saw an opportunity to supply his
customers’ demand and launched
the first commercial Lionfish
fishery, Norman’s Lionfish.
Chadwick continues to pursue
his entrepreneurial passions in
the food service industry: he
currently manages Goa Taco in
Manhattan and the Grey Lady
restaurants located in Manhattan,
Nantucket, Aspen, and Montauk.
As a result of operating in upscale
and seasonal locations, Chadwick
finds it difficult to provide his
restaurant staff with short-term,
affordable housing options. To
solve this ongoing problem, he is
constructing eco-friendly, mobile
tiny houses.
The idea came to life when
Chadwick purchased two
houseboats as residences for
his restaurant staff during the
summer season, and placed
them in the port near his Grey
Lady-Nantucket location. Though
Chadwick solved the housing
issue for one of his restaurant
locations, he couldn’t bring
his convenient houseboats to
Aspen. He decided to design and
commission the construction
of a set of tiny homes that could
be moved between his various
restaurant locations, accommo-dating
his business and his staff.
Instead of creating traditional
lumber-and-shingle tiny houses,
Chadwick’s homes will feature
a fresh design based on clean-lines
and constructed of a novel
renewable material: hempcrete.
The plant-based, eco-friendly
material and seamless design of
his houses makes them weath-er-
resistant, lighter than average,
and better insulated. The future
hempcrete structures will utilize
the power sources at campsites
or trailer parks, as well as run off
their own solar-generated power.
The best part? The structures are
completely American made.
Chadwick’s passion for innova-tion
and his entrepreneurial spirit
have allowed him to pursue an
increasingly diverse career path.
These characteristics are what the
integrated clusters model intends
to give to PSU’s students: the con-fidence
and multitude of skills to
be successful across a broad range
of career ventures.

When it comes to physical and mental health, Murphy con-tends,
sometimes less is more. “There is a common miscon-ception

Drawing on history and humor

Featuring intricate illustrations of women from history, pop culture, politics, the arts and more, 33

For Finnegan, choosing the women to highlight was a labor of love. “The women in this book are all

Since her Plymouth State College days,
Marion (Fellows) Patterson ’71 has looked
back on those formative years with gratitude
for their impact on the person she is today:
gaining both practical knowledge and life
lessons from faculty mentors; emerging from
insecurity as a young woman among friends
who truly cared; appreciating the natural
beauty from the campus overlooking the
Pemigewasset Valley; and challenging herself
and others in her Health, Physical Education,
and Recreation major.
Marion, and her husband Rich, now in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, have long been faithful
supporters of Plymouth State through their
Annual Fund contributions. They recently went
a step beyond by making a provision in their

and its students. As Marion wrote,
“Even with a lifetime of earning modest
salaries, Rich and I believe we can repay
our debt of gratitude to Plymouth State
by establishing a fund that will grow over
time through regular contributions and
interest earned. Anyone who is interested
can set up this type of endowed fund. The
feeling is so rewarding.”
By doing so, Marion and Rich are helping the
next generation of Plymouth State students
become the educated, compassionate,

Winter/Spring 2014 ■ Plymouth Magazine 1
In fall of 2012, the Royal
Opera House Muscat invited
the Glimmerglass Festival
to present its acclaimed
production of The Music Man
in a new theater in Oman, on
the Persian Gulf. Jake Josef ’08
was technical director for this
unique experience.

In this issue, we discuss a few of PSU’s successful young alumni, who are creating
engaging careers and making a difference. These dynamic alumni have graduated
between 2000 and 2013.
Among alumni of the Department of Health and Human Performance, PSU’s
third largest department with 12 varied undergraduate and graduate options, are
Ichiro Kitano ’03G, a manual therapy specialist for the Philadelphia Phillies baseball
team; Keith Belmore ’05, a faculty member and clinical coordinator at the University
of Missouri School of Health; and Eric Wilson ’07, an entrepreneur with a growing
business focused on corrective exercise and personal training. All have careers
reflective of strong opportunities provided at PSU, and all three are employing their
PSU degrees to improve others’ health and wellness.
PSU’s meteorology program is unique in New Hampshire and is developing data
used in analyses worldwide. Katie Laro ’12, ’13G, participated in both NASA and
state-funded research as an undergraduate and presented her research on predicting
surface winds at an event on Capitol Hill in Washington DC. Her graduate research,
now extending beyond graduation, involves data analysis for a New Hampshire com-pany
producing a prototype of a lightning sensor that could allow businesses such as
golf courses to keep people safer.
The Department of Music, Theatre, and Dance is proud of its strong job place-ment.
Cassandra Marcella ’00 is a music educator and recent recipient of a Yale
Educators Award for inspiring young people; Jake Josef ’08 is the technical director
at the Glimmerglass Festival; Kathleen Pantos ’08, a dancer and choreographer, has
her own dance company called the Pantos Project; and Daniel Brevik ’11, is singing
with Opera Theatre of Saint Louis. These alumni with emphases in music education,
theatre, dance, and voice enjoy professional careers bringing to others their passion
for the arts.
The feature on the Department of Criminal Justice highlights one of PSU’s new-est
and fastest-growing programs, preparing students for a wide range of careers in
criminology, criminal justice, and law. Already Amanda Johnson ’08 has achieved a
long-held goal of becoming a New Hampshire state trooper; and Penina Wallace ’13
has entered law school.
These are samples. Recently, Joseph “Joey” Lee ’06 was chosen the 2014 New
Hampshire Teacher of the Year; a social studies teacher at Pinkerton Academy, he
will be New Hampshire’s candidate for the national award. Catherine Dwinal ’10
has just been named by the Technology Institute for Music Educators (TI:ME) as
the recipient of the national 2014 Mike Kovins TI:ME Teacher of the Year Award for
outstanding educators who have introduced technology into their classrooms.
In upcoming issues we will present the stories of other alumni as well, and we
hope that those of you who are alumni will stay in touch with the PSU Alumni
Association and your departments. For faculty and staff members, there is nothing
more rewarding than continuing to watch the progress of former students, now
friends. As PSU makes its case for the power of a PSU education, we will be asking
alumni for information; you will be helping PSU in providing it. The more we know
of our alumni and friends, the richer is the picture of the PSU community.
Sara Jayne Steen, President
WELCOME TO PLYMOUTH MAGAZINE
“... there is nothing
more rewarding than
continuing to watch
the progress of former
students, now friends.”
PSU photography professor John Anderson was selected last summer
as artist in residence for the White Mountain National Forest (WMNF)
in partnership with the Arts Alliance of Northern New Hampshire. The
WMNF Artist-in-Residence program offers professional and emerging
artists in all media—visual and performing artists, craftspeople, writers,
composers, eco-artists and media artists—an opportunity to pursue their
art form while being inspired by the forest. Anderson shared his work
with members of the public in September, and hopes to exhibit more
of the work in 2014. The Artist-in-Residence program began in 2011 as
part of the Weeks Centennial Celebration. At left is one of the more than
74,000 stunning photographs Anderson took during his residency.

PSU partner
wins National
Curriculum
Development
award
PSU recently celebrated, with
state governmental and business
leaders and educators, its part-nership
with the New Hampshire
Association for Supervision and
Curriculum Development on
The New Hampshire Journal of
Education, edited at Plymouth
State. This year the NHASCD
was named the outstanding
educational affiliate in the
nation, with the journal, edited
by Stevens-Bristow Professor of
Education Marianne True, an
important consideration for the
award. The PSU student chapter
of NHASCD also has been recog-nized
for excellence.
PSU Researchers
Assist with New
Atlantic Coast
Ecosystem Study
A team of multistate researchers
will conduct a three-year study
of the many factors affecting
the health of the NH-Maine
shared coastal ecosystem. This
collaboration, known as the
New England SusTainability
Consortium (NEST) and funded
by a $6 million award from the
National Science Foundation,
aims to strengthen the scientific
basis for decision-making for
the management of recreational
beaches and shellfish harvesting.
Participating in this study
enables PSU to expand research
on the region’s water resources
and human impact on water qual-ity
into new locations with new
partners. PSU will participate in
the project through expanding
a current water research project
to the Gulf of Maine, leading
workforce development initia-tives,
and examining inclusive
decision-making as a product of
ecosystem research. Faculty and
students from PSU’s Center for the
Environment and Department of
Environmental Science and Policy
will be involved in the project.
PSU Honors
Former Governor
John Lynch and
olympic Skier and
Philanthropist
Penny Pitou
Former Olympic skier Penny
Pitou and former NH Governor
John Lynch were honored at PSU’s
Fall Convocation.
Governor Hassan and PSU
Alumni Association President
Amy Begg ’97 presented
Governor Lynch with the Robert
Frost Contemporary American
Award, named for poet Robert
Frost, who taught at Plymouth
Normal School in 1911. The
award recognizes individuals
whose extraordinary service
to the state and nation best
exemplifies Robert Frost’s values
of individuality, hard work,
humanitarianism, and devotion
to the country “North of Boston.”
“John Lynch … has given
decades of his life to promoting
excellence in public higher edu-cation,
the business community,
and the state of New Hampshire,”
President Sara Jayne Steen said.
“He is a respected leader who has
invested himself in serving oth-ers
with intelligence, optimism,
energy, and commitment. And he
has made a difference in the lives
of many people who will never
know or be able to thank him, as
we do today.”
Former Olympic ski racer and
Lakes Region businesswoman
Penny Pitou received the Granite
State Award, which is bestowed
on New Hampshire citizens,
agencies, corporations, and
foundations whose achievements
have made significant contribu-tions.
Pitou was a trailblazer in
women’s skiing and a leader in
New Hampshire philanthropy.
“Penny Pitou has never seen
barriers, only problems to be
solved, and then she addressed
them,” Steen said. “And she has
been a role model in seeing that
those who followed her would
have the opportunities, whether
through good coaching or
support organizations or scholar-ships,
to enable them to succeed.”

Enterprise Center
at Plymouth
Celebrates Grand
Opening
If the early success of the
Enterprise Center at Plymouth
(ECP) is any indication, the busi-ness
incubator and accelerator
has a very bright future. The ECP,
located at One Bridge Street, is at
full capacity just three weeks after
opening its doors with five fledg-ling
businesses setting up shop in
the state-of-the-art facility. The
ECP’s October 15 grand opening
ceremony drew more than 100
people to celebrate the goal of job
creation and economic develop-ment
in central New Hampshire.
Governor Maggie Hassan,
President Sara Jayne Steen,
and Dinah Adkins, president
emerita of the National Business
Incubator Association and
an expert on rural economic
development, addressed guests
during the ceremony in the lobby
of the Silver Center for the Arts at
Plymouth State University.
“New Hampshire stands at the
threshold of a bright new future,
as well positioned as any state
to lead the country in innova-tive
economic growth,” Hassan
said. “The Enterprise Center at
Plymouth will play an integral
role in seizing this opportunity,
supporting entrepreneurs, small
business owners and economic
development throughout central
New Hampshire.”
The ECP provides a one-stop-shop
for businesses throughout
the region seeking advice and
counseling, services, leased
space, mentoring, and net-working.
The Grafton County
Economic Development Council
is providing the physical
location and building, using $2
million in federal, state, and cor-porate
funding; PSU is providing
staffing, campus-wide business
services, and intellectual capital.
Santore Awarded
American Prize in
Composition
Jonathan Santore, profes-sor
of music and chair of the
Department of Music, Theatre,
and Dance, has been awarded the
American Prize in Composition
2013 in the category for profes-sional
composers of choral music.
Santore was honored for his
submission of selected choral
works. According to the judges,
his work “displays impressive
skill, expressivity and contrast in
every musical selection offered
in the portfolio. The listener is
drawn in from the start.”
Santore appreciates the exter-nal
validation that receiving the
American Prize gives to his work.
“Every creative and performing
artist everywhere values the good
opinion of peers in their field,
and I’m both proud and humbled
to have received this honor.”
In Memory:
Ray Burton ’62
The late Raymond S. Burton ’62
was honored at PSU with a
memorial service held on
December 14. Hundreds of peo-ple
across the region gathered to
pay tribute to Burton, a member
of the New Hampshire Executive
Council and a Grafton County
Commissioner and a symbol of
public service in the state.
A week before his passing,
PSU honored Burton with
its Henry W. Blair Award for
Distinguished Public Service.
Burton, a 1962 graduate
of what was then Plymouth
Teachers College, began his
career as a teacher and principal.
He later became an adjunct fac-ulty
member in Plymouth State’s
Department of Social Sciences.
After becoming a member of the
Executive Council in 1977, he
established an internship pro-gram
for New Hampshire college
students to learn more about the
workings of state government.
Many of Burton’s former interns
are now in public service.

Strategic Enrollment
Planning: A Dynamic
Collaboration, edited by
Jim Hundrieser ’90G,
vice president for enroll-ment
management and
student affairs
Competition for qualified
students is on the rise
among colleges and
universities. Recruitment
professionals must
rethink their strategies in
order to attract enough
students to maintain their
programs. Edited by Jim
Hundrieser, with a team of
college enrollment leaders
contributing chapters,
Strategic Enrollment
Planning provides valuable
insights on how higher
education leaders can
align mission, vision,
and values with shifting
market needs and expecta-tions.
Hundrieser places
a strong emphasis on the
importance of using hard
facts to inform all recruit-ment
decisions. “Setting
benchmarks, constantly
monitoring them, and
pushing the organization
to a higher level requires
data, data, data,” he says.
True Colors, Marcel
Lebrun, professor of
education and special
education
After noticing a lack of
awareness in educators in
how to deal with the rela-tively
new phenomenon of
gay and lesbian families,
and especially considering
the social and political
changes of the past year,
Marcel Lebrun wrote True
Colors to educate future
and present educators
about how the meaning
and structure of family has
changed. Using personal
stories from alternative,
gay, and blended families,
Lebrun explores the issues
of surrogacy, reproductive
technology, adoption,
and bullying. The book
includes a comprehensive
children’s literature sec-tion
to support children
of gay and lesbian parents.
“My goal is to ensure that
all children of same-sex
couples receive a quality
and enriching education
from educators that are
informed, accepting, and
open-minded to diversity,”
Lebrun says. “Sharing the
content of this book with
parents, educators, medi-cal
personnel, law makers,
and the neighbor next door
will go far in building a
more positive, civil, and
kinder society.”
Deviance Across
Cultures: Constructions
of Difference, Robert
Heiner, professor of
anthropology-sociology
In this substantially
updated second edition
to his acclaimed Deviance
Across Cultures, Robert
Heiner investigates the
social construction of devi-ance.
He asks if “deviant”
and “criminal” behaviors
are inherently wrong or
evil considering that, as he
writes in his introduction,
“Different societies at
different times construct
different categories by
which people differentiate
among themselves.” New
to this edition are 21 addi-tional
articles addressing
such topics as economic
conditions, drug use, and
criminality; discussion
questions following each
article; and an increased
focus on methods.

English artists of the early
twentieth century. Gill
designed well-known
typefaces in addition to
illustrating hundreds of

his adopted hometown,
Landaff, NH, calling it “a
microcosm of the larger
natural world, having its
own beauty, rigors and
mystery.” He writes with

Mother Knows Best
Decades later, Lindberg, now
a Carnegie Foundation NH
Professor of the Year, a recipient
of a New Hampshire Excellence
in Education Award, and,
most recently, an Emmy award
winner for an educational televi-sion
program about bullying,
acknowledges that her mother
may have been onto something.
Apparently, Lindberg just had to
find the right subjects to teach.
In her case, this has turned out to
be education and integrated arts,
areas that allow her to marry her
interests in theatre, music, and
visual arts with education, thus
reaching a greater number of
people than she otherwise might
have in just one of these fields.
Lindberg’s creative blending
of her academic and artistic
interests has paid off, not only in
her career successes, but in reach-ing
hundreds of thousands of
children with positive messages
over the years. She has brought
her passion for integrated arts
to life at PSU as artistic director
of TIGER (Theatre Integrating
Guidance, Education and
Responsibility), a professional
theatre company designed to
help children, schools, parents,
and communities deal proac-tively
and positively with social
issues facing children in schools
today, and ETC (Educational
Theatre Collaborative), an
innovative arts education
program. Thanks to Lindberg’s
work with TIGER, which made
its television debut on New
Hampshire Public Television in
PSU Collaboration Leads to Emmy
When Trish Lindberg was a 17-year-old musician, artist, and actor, her mother—a
teacher herself—told her she would make a great teacher. Lindberg looked her mother
right in the eye and said, “I will never be a teacher!”
2012, PSU has now added to its
trophy shelf a regional Emmy for
best-produced Children/Youth
Program, a national bronze
Telly award, and first place
in the feature category of the
New Hampshire Association of
Broadcasters awards competition.
ETC was recently awarded the
2012–2013 New England Theatre
Conference’s All New England
Moss Hart Memorial Award for
its production of Marking the
Moment, an original musical that
honored the 250th anniversary of
the Town of Plymouth. This is the
second time ETC has won this
prestigious award. But Lindberg
is quick to point out these awards
are the result of a team effort.
“Everything that has been accom-plished
at Plymouth State has
been because of collaboration,”
she says. “My part is just one
piece of the whole.”
Educational Theatre is
a Team Sport
Lindberg pays unstinting tribute
to the many supporters of the
organizations she has helped
form and direct over the years.
“So many hands touch the work
of TIGER and ETC,” she says,
“from the producers, designers,
musical director, choreographer,
stage manager, and cast members
to business individuals, schools,
and community volunteers.” Key
long-time community supporters
such as Alex Ray of the Common
Man, Tom and Susan Stepp, and
Richard and Carol Gerken ’67,
along with new ones like Joan
and Ed Kirschner of Plymouth
General Dentistry, have joined
forces with PSU to help Lindberg
bring positive messages and role
models to hundreds of class-rooms
and theatres statewide and
beyond (even to Egypt). With
the launch of “TIGER Takes on
Bullying,” the television program
co-produced with NHPTV, the
number of children receiving
these important anti-bullying
messages is now spreading expo-nentially.

Keith Belmore earned his bachelor
of science in athletic training
in 2005 and is currently a faculty
member and clinical coordinator at
the University of Missouri School of
Health Professions. He oversees the
clinical education component of the
school’s new athletic training program,
a responsibility that entails placing
students in clinical sites and evaluating
their performance, their preceptors,
and the clinical site itself. He’s also
responsible for a variety of administra-tive
aspects of the new program, from
curriculum design to student recruit-ment,
and he teaches a course in the
program. On top of this, he dedicates
eight hours a week to working with
student-athletes in a clinical setting.
“One of the most important aspects
of my job is injury and illness preven-tion,”
Belmore says. “My colleagues
and I create preventative exercise and
strengthening programs, emphasize the
importance of hydration and proper
nutrition, and educate athletes, coaches,
parents, and administrators on injury
and illness prevention strategies.”
Belmore believes that the connec-tion
between emotional and physical
health is important and underesti-mated,
and he is as concerned with his
student-athletes’ psychological, social,
and emotional needs as he is about
their physical needs. “They identify
themselves as athletes, so if they’re
sidelined due to an injury or illness,
that can affect their morale, their
perception of themselves, and their
emotional health,” he says. “That’s why
we take a holistic approach and care for
and treat the whole athlete.”
Belmore credits PSU with giving
him a solid foundation in athletic
training and believes his early hands-on
clinical experiences were especially
beneficial to his career today. As a
sophomore, he had the opportunity to
work with the men’s soccer team. “At a
big Division I school, you don’t get that
experience as early,” he says, noting
that PSU’s smaller class sizes translated
into more opportunities to work
side-by-side with faculty. “At PSU, I
was able to use the skills I learned in
class right away—skills like wound
care, taping, and therapeutic exercise.
As our nation moves from a health care system focused on treating illness, disease, and injury to
one focused on wellness and prevention, health care and fitness professionals are expected to lead
the way. Here’s how three alumni from PSU’s Department of Health and Human Performance are
ensuring safety in sport and exercise.
SPORTS AND EXERCISE IN A
TIME OF INJURY PREVENTION

students at PSU and had an opportunity to work with the Concord Quarry Dogs before making it to
the big leagues. John Hsu photo. Below, Kitano’s minor league baseball card.

Starting to learn those skills early on
with my clinical preceptor was invalu-able
to me.”
After earning his master of
education in health education and
promotion, Belmore did a one-year
post-professional residency program
at New Hampshire Musculoskeletal
Institute (NHMI), a nonprofit
cofounded by HHP alumnus Nick
Vailas ’76 dedicated to advancing
knowledge in musculoskeletal care and
sports medicine and to promoting and
providing a safe sports environment
for athletes. “I spent my mornings on
rotations with health care specialists
in orthopedics, dermatology, ENT,
primary care, and neurology,” he says.
“In the afternoons I worked with the
local high school and was head athletic
trainer for an arena football team. It
was an intensive year that blended
academics and clinical practice.”
Belmore returned to PSU after his
residency, serving as head athletic
trainer for football, clinical preceptor,
and instructor for athletic training
courses for three years. Then he
returned to NHMI to head its Sports
Medicine Outreach Program, oversee-ing
athletic training outreach to nine
NH high schools. He also served as a
clinical mentor/preceptor for NHMI’s
residency program.
Wanting more clinical exposure for
himself, Belmore accepted his current
position at the University of Missouri,
where he has struck a balance between
being a clinician and an educator. He’s
eager to conduct research projects on
emergency management of athletes
with spine injury, his research focus
during his residency at NHMI.
While Keith Belmore is helping to
ensure the safety and well-being
of student-athletes, Ichiro Kitano ’03G
is doing the same for professional ath-letes
as the manual therapy specialist
for the Philadelphia Phillies baseball
team. Manual therapy is a specialized
form of physical therapy that incor-porates
specific soft tissue and joint
mobilization techniques to promote tis-sue
healing. Not only is manual therapy
used to treat injury and reduce pain, it
can also prevent injury by improving
muscle flexibility and range of motion,
reducing recovery time, and increasing
blood flow. There are also tremendous
physiological and psychological
benefits to manual therapy, including
relaxation and stress reduction.
Kitano earned his undergraduate
degree in his native Japan, then came
to Springfield College to learn English.
From there, Kitano set his sights on
earning a master’s degree in athletic
training. “There were only a few schools
in the country that offered an athletic
training program at the graduate
level,” says Kitano, who, like Belmore,
appreciated PSU’s smaller size and
numerous hands-on learning oppor-tunities.
His PSU athletic training
education included rotations with the
women’s soccer team and the baseball
team. “PSU gave me many great oppor-tunities
to work with student-athletes in
a variety of sports and settings,” he says.
“I learned so much during my two years
in the program.”
After he earned his master’s, Kitano
did an internship at Brown University
for an academic year. In the nine years
since, he’s worked with baseball teams,
first in the minor league, and for the
past three years, in the major league.
“My position is a little different than a
regular athletic trainer,” says Kitano,
who works with two traditional athletic
trainers as part of a care team. “Ninety
percent of my work is manual therapy,
including massage, muscle release tech-niques,
and working on soft tissue to
prevent injury and speed up recovery.
The other ten percent is more tradi-tional
athletic training work, such as
caring for injured players on the field,
assessing injuries, and rehabilitation.”
Kitano is pleased to see that more
teams are recognizing the value in
having a manual therapy specialist on
staff. “It used to be that teams would
have only two athletic trainers, and
there wasn’t much focus on injury
prevention beyond warm-up exercises
and stretching,” he says. “Now, there’s
a trend toward having three people
on staff: two athletic trainers and a
manual therapy specialist who work
together to keep the players healthy
and ready to play.”

Eric Wilson graduated from PSU
in 2007 with a degree in exercise
and sports physiology, and works with
people of all ages who want to get
fit and be healthy. After earning his
personal trainer certification the sum-mer
after graduation, Wilson landed
his dream job as a personal trainer at
Boston Sports Club, where he worked
for more than four years. “I’d put
clients through an assessment to see the
way they moved, what their fitness level
was, and learn what their goals were.”
A year into his new job, Boston
Sports Club hired a new fitness direc-tor,
who changed the way the gym
prescribed exercise. It marked a turn-ing
point in Wilson’s career and life.
Through the new fitness manager,
Wilson learned about corrective
exercise, a system of training that
helps improve muscle imbalances and
movement efficiency to decrease the
risk of injury. “A lot of people who
sit the majority of the day are tight
in their hips and shoulders, and this
throws off their movement pattern and
kinesiology,” he says. “What we do is
focus on flexibility and balance, and
getting the body in a good position to
work out, and teach our clients to do
corrective exercise on their own. When
they come in later, they are moving
much better and we can go into a
more aggressive resistance training or
cardiovascular training program. With
that knowledge, I felt that I was offer-ing
something unique to a wide level of
clientele: older, younger, injured, non-injured,
and people interested in losing
weight or in building muscle.”
Wilson also experienced the ben-efits
of corrective exercise in his own
workout routine. “Nagging injuries
started to fade away,” he says. “I didn’t
realize how poorly I moved or how bad
I felt until I started feeling better.”
In 2011, Wilson opened his own
business, Movement Sciences, which
is dedicated to teaching people cor-rective
exercise. “I was able to bring
a number of my clients with me, and
many of them have kept their gym
memberships,” he says.
Now he’s also teaching other
personal trainers about corrective
exercise through his recently estab-lished
American Center of Corrective
Exercise and Personal Training
(ACCEPT). Along with mastering cor-rective
exercise techniques, Wilson’s
students are required to earn their cer-tification
in personal training through
the National Association of Sports
Medicine, something that’s currently
not required of personal trainers.
“I’ve started this school,” says Wilson,
“because there’s no accrediting body
or agency that says you can or cannot
be a personal trainer. There are no
educational requirements, and poorly
qualified trainers can end up doing
more harm than good to their clients’
health. I saw a huge opportunity, a way
to start bridging that gap. What I’m
trying to do is seed gyms and personal
training studios with highly trained
and educated personal trainers who
can help people realize the benefits of
flexibility and balance in exercise.”
Although Movement Sciences
and ACCEPT are relatively new,
Wilson has high hopes for both of
his endeavors, based on his current
number of clients and students, and
the emphasis our nation’s health care
reform is placing on prevention and
healthy lifestyles. ■ Barbra Alan

Student Spotlight: Katie Laro
a force of nature
Jon Gilbert Fox photo.
Winter/Spring 2014 ■ Plymouth Magazine 11
If you live in New Hampshire,
or have ever lived in New
Hampshire, you’ve likely heard
this or said it yourself countless
times. The Granite State is known
for its predictably unpredictable
weather—and is even proud of it.
For Katie Laro ’12, ’13G, it was
the unpredictability of weather
that got her interested in meteo-rology
back in elementary school.
“My fourth-grade teacher handed
out a book on the development
cycle of tornadoes,” she recalls. “I
was immediately interested and
that interest grew into a need to
understand how things work in
our skies.”
When it was time for her
to choose a college to attend,
Laro chose PSU for its stellar
meteorology program. In her
sophomore year she was given
the opportunity to apply what she
was learning in class to the real
world when her mentor, Professor
Emeritus of Meteorology James
Koermer, invited her to conduct
research on convective wind
climatology at Cape Canaveral
in Florida. “I couldn’t pass it up,”
says Laro.
(CUR) annual Posters on the
Hill reception on Capitol Hill in
Washington DC. Laro’s presenta-tion
was one of 74 selected out
of 850 entries for the reception.
She also had the opportunity to
present her work to the American
Meteorological Society’s national
conference in Seattle.
As a graduate student in PSU’s
Master of Science in Applied
Meteorology program, Laro once
again teamed up with the now-retired
Koermer on research.
This time their focus is lightning,
which poses an even greater
threat to air and space travel than
convective winds do. “Professor
Koermer knew my work, and
my work ethic,” says Laro of her
latest research project. “He asked
me if I was interested in this as
my thesis project. Once again, I
couldn’t say no.”
The focus of this project is to
test a lightning sensor prototype
for a company that wants to pro-duce
low-cost lightning detectors
for businesses whose revenue is
tied directly to weather condi-tions,
such as golf courses and
stadiums. The device will sense
where lightning is, allowing users
to estimate when it will come
their way. “Right now, most of
the sensors that are out there are
government-run. You can obtain
data from them, but it’s not as
convenient as having your own
sensor,” Laro says.
“The sensor is stationary—you
put it out in a field, leave it there,
and it collects data,” she contin-ues.
“The company tested it in
the lab, but there’s only so much
you can do in a lab that mimics
the real world, so they asked
Professor Koermer to field-test it.”
Alas, travel to sunny Florida
wasn’t required for this research
project. “I’m working very
remotely,” Laro says. Koermer,
who lives 30 minutes from where
the sensor is stationed, regularly
collects data from the sensor,
downloads it to his computer, and
uploads it onto a website where
Laro can access it and analyze
it on her laptop. “My goal is to
provide the company with the
most stratified analysis that I can:
To tell them what works, what
doesn’t, and why so they can
make the best possible product
for consumers.”
Now that Laro has earned her
master’s degree and is nearing
the end of her research project,
she is contemplating what’s next
for her. “I’d like to get a job in the
field, and take whatever comes
next with the same excitement
I’ve had as a student,” she says.
“I’m looking forward to gaining
more experience in the kinds of
research I’ve already done, and
exploring what else is out there.”
While her education and
research have shed greater
light on what happens in our
skies and why, Laro still finds
herself as awestruck when she
looks skyward as she was as
a fourth grader. “I’ve always
been fascinated by the sky and
clouds and how they evolve,”
she says, “and now that I have
some understanding of how and
why they do, I find it even more
fascinating.” ■ Barbra Alan
If you don’t
like the
weather,
wait a
minute.”
Each year since 2005, Koermer
has tapped some of his most
promising students to work with
him and personnel from the
45th Weather Squadron at Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station on a
convective wind study. The study
is backed by the NASA-funded
New Hampshire Space Grant
Consortium, of which PSU’s
meteorology program is an affili-ate
member. Convective winds
are strong winds associated with
thunderstorms, and they pose
a major threat to space center
and air force activities, second
only to lightning. Interestingly,
these winds have received far less
research attention for this region
than lightning has, and many of
the wind tools and techniques
used by forecasters were based on
limited data or were designed for
a different region of the country.
Koermer and his students
have worked to change that. Over
the years, they’ve compiled data
for what is now an 18-year cli-matology
study, which provides
valuable information to assist
Air Force forecasters in issuing
timely warnings for convective
wind events.
Laro’s responsibilities included
gathering regional data and
identifying convective wind
episodes, which are periods of
thunderstorms or heavy rain
showers that can produce danger-ous
surface winds. She enjoyed
conducting research so much, and
Koermer was so pleased with her
performance, that she returned to
Florida during her senior year to
continue her work.
Florida isn’t the only place
Laro’s research has taken her. In
her senior year, she presented her
work to members of Congress,
federal government officials, and
others at the prestigious Council
of Undergraduate Research
I’m looking forward
to gaining more
experience in the kinds
of research I’ve already
done, and exploring
what else is out there.

underwent numerous surgeries
to remove a tumor that developed
on his femur, and has been in and
out of a wheelchair ever since.
When Russell heard of Tyler’s
story, and his interest in “join-ing”
the men’s ice hockey team,
he wasted no time in putting the
play into action. “The players
have gained a lot as individuals
and as a team,” since meeting
Tyler, notes Russell. “Working
with Tyler allows team members
to view their own challenges
from a new perspective.”
The first time you meet Tyler,
you discover that he doesn’t allow
his physical challenges to get in
the way of doing what he wants
to do, and he loves being part
of the men’s ice hockey team.
From helping the team welcome

shavings, Tyler is truly part of the
team, whose members welcome
his playfulness and boundless
energy. And after a scrimmage, it’s
Tyler who, from the heart of the
huddle, leads the team in a final
cheer and emerges with a grin.
“The guys love having him
around and we’re honored to be
a part of his battle,” says team
captain Dave Walters, a graduate
student in international busi-ness.
“Watching him go through
something like this and still come
to the rink with a smile on his
face helps me put my own life
into perspective and realize how
lucky I’ve been. He’s truly been
an inspiration to not only me, but
the whole team.”
Prior to becoming head coach
of the women’s lacrosse team,
Kristin Tracy worked in the
Plymouth public school system,
where she learned firsthand the
difference mentoring can make
in young children’s lives. When
she came to PSU, she realized
her team of high-achieving
student-athletes would make
excellent role models for local
schoolchildren, and created a
campus organization, Positive
Athletes Working with Students
(PAWS), to connect students
with service opportunities.
Each week, members of the la-crosse
team visit with elementary
school students for mentoring,
tutoring, and simply hanging out.
Carly Floyd ’15 has been involved
with PAWS for the past three
years. “It’s a great experience.
The kids really look up to the
student-athletes,” she says.
One particular elementary-aged
boy, however, was painfully
shy, especially around Floyd and
her teammates. Floyd says that
although it was difficult to even
get him to tell her his name at
first, she was eventually able to
build a rapport with the little
boy, who afterward walked her
around the athletic fields and
playgrounds at his school, intro-ducing
her as his friend.
The seemingly simple act
of shooting hoops on the play-ground,
tutoring or mentoring,
or simply giving these students
someone to talk to, provides
them with the motivation and
encouragement that they need.
“Sometimes we get so wrapped
up in our sport it really helps us
to play for something bigger than
ourselves,” says Floyd.
Molly Gleason ’15 agrees. “I
strongly believe that service has
made us a better team. It has not
only been a bonding experience
for us, but it also reminds us that
as a group we have a huge impact
on others’ lives.”
While dedicating their time
is a great way to offer support,
Tracy’s team has also participated
in numerous fund-raising efforts,
and recently raised more than
$6,000 for the Wounded Warrior
Project, a veterans service
organization that offers a variety
of programs and services for
wounded veterans of the
military actions following 9/11.

filiz otucu on democracy and the middle east
Filiz Otucu is a professor of
political science and specializes
in international relations, Middle
Eastern politics, and the United
Nations. A native of Turkey, she
earned her MA at the University
of Central Oklahoma, and
her PhD from the University
of Kentucky. Otucu teaches
courses on politics and conflict
in the Middle East, terrorism
and counterterrorism, and
political Islamic fundamentalism.
Plymouth Magazine asked
Professor Otucu to share her
thoughts on democracy and the
Middle East, where Islam is the
predominant religion.
If you would want us to pay
attention to one thing about
our view of the Middle East,
what would that be?
We need to pay attention to our
misperceptions, be open-minded
and understand where the other
person is coming from. A big part
of understanding is becoming
aware of our stereotypes—not
to put them aside, which is very
difficult—but to be aware of our
biases and start questioning. A
simple example: many of us think
jihad means “holy war.” But for
99.9 percent of Muslims jihad is
an inner struggle to be a good
Muslim, to be a good person.
We get most of what we know
about the Middle East from the
media. If they focus on what
moderates are talking about and
what Islam is really about, how
many people will watch? But if the
story is about a bombing, we watch.
Media is a part of our culture,
and we fall prey to its influence.
Why does the Middle East seem
so anti-American?
It’s important to note that, with
the exception of a very small
group of extremists, the major-ity
of Middle Easterners are not
against Americans. They are only
critical of American foreign policy
decisions because they pay the
price for them. When the West
gets involved militarily, civilians
often are killed. Collateral damage
happens, but the majority of these
civilians are innocent people and
somebody’s loved one. An apology
does not cut it.
When your loved ones suffer
or die because of sanctions or
military attacks and your life
becomes so desperate, you are
more inclined to listen to extrem-ists
and be manipulated. We have
to be careful about what we are
doing and how it affects people’s
lives—the consequences of our
actions. We should not give
extremist leaders reason to get
better at their propaganda and
win people over.

How can the US support democ-racy
in the Middle East?
There is a debate about whether
Islam is compatible with democ-racy.
Increasingly, Muslims
themselves are saying “yes,” and
Islamic political movements and
parties are deciding to take part
in elections whenever possible.
Terminology matters. You cannot
sell Western liberal democracy to
many Muslims because Muslims
associate it with Western colonial-ism.
But some are embracing
features of democracy like human
rights, elections, and the rule of law.
These concepts are consistent with
the Islamic concepts of ijma (con-sensus)
and shura (consultation).
The Islamic democratic move-ment
is a work in progress. Indigen-ous
calls for democratic reforms are
being heard in almost every part of
the Muslim world. Unfortunately,
pro-Western Arab and Muslim
dictators, not necessarily Islamic
activists, have been blocking any
real democratic opening.
Supporting democratization is
not about elections, but rather how
we can help liberalization of these
societies. The West can play a role
by not supporting dictatorships,
and by pressuring authoritarian
regimes when they attack their
own people. We can exert pressure
for gradual reforms. The Middle
Eastern countries need a strong
civil society to produce leaders and
mobilize the public around demo-cratic
movement. Democratization
should come from both above and
below. We can help civil society
organizations to gain strength,
making it bottom up, people
demanding those liberties. We can
pressure the leadership to allow
civil liberties, to include them in
the constitution and to guard them
very dearly. Then, real democracy
can flourish in the Middle East. ■

PSU’s Department of Music, Theatre,
and Dance is the starting point for
alumni pursuing a wide variety of artistic
careers. From here, they go out into the
world to do what they love: they teach
in Connecticut and Kuwait, perform
on cruise ships and Off-Broadway,
work backstage in Boston and Oman,
and so much more. Here’s how four
alumni, each representing a facet of
the multidisciplinary department, are
achieving success in the arts.

Cassandra Marcella ’00
recorded her career ambition
in her high school yearbook.
Thanks to a series of mentors, her
education in MTD, and her own
focus and dedication, Marcella
achieved that ambition: to be the
band director at West Haven (CT)
High School, in her hometown.
	Marcella’s career aspirations
were inspired by her middle
school and high school band
directors, Tom Gibbons and Skip
Crabtree. When she began to
look at colleges, it was Crabtree
who encouraged her to check out
Plymouth State.
understanding. I had the faculty’s
support in leaving and in coming
back. I don’t think I would have
found that at any other school.”
	 She was able to pick up where
she left off and finish her degree.
That was important because back
home, people were waiting for her
to fill a new elementary school
band director position. Two years
after taking that job, she learned
that her mentor Crabtree was
retiring from West Haven High
School. Marcella was hired to
replace him, and pays forward all
the mentoring and care that she
received as a student.
	 “People tell you that you’ll
know you’re at the right school
the minute you get out of the car,”
says Marcella. “That was abso-lutely
true when I came to PSU.”
	 She studied saxophone
with Professor of Music Rik
Pfenninger and instrumental
conducting with Gary Corcoran,
now professor emeritus of music.
“I felt so welcome. I knew I’d
made the right decision,” she
says. “Professors were genuinely
interested in the students and
everyone was very caring. It’s
never been recreated in anything
else I’ve ever done.”
	 But Marcella’s life took a
very difficult turn. “One of the
toughest things I dealt with at
Plymouth State was when my
father passed away from cancer,”
she says. When Marcella felt she
needed to take some time off
from college, she says, “All my
professors were so helpful and
	 As Corcoran says, “Cassie
is the type of teacher that other
teachers aspire to be. The dedica-tion
she shows her students at
West Haven High School is
beyond measure.”
And it’s appreciated. Marcella
describes her former student
Brenda Calderon as “valedicto-rian
from her freshman year,”
and helped Calderon with her
application to Yale University.
When she was accepted, Marcella
says, “I was more excited for her
than she was for herself!” But
Calderon had a surprise for her
band director and mentor.
“On the first day of school
this year,” Marcella says, “I was
going through all the mail that
had come in over the summer
and dropping most of it straight
into the wastebasket. There
was a package from Yale and I
almost threw it out.” To her great
surprise, the package contained

a Yale Educators Award. Without
telling Marcella, Calderon had
nominated her for the award,
which recognizes teachers
around the world “who have
supported and inspired their stu-dents
to achieve at high levels.”
Supporting and inspiring
students: That’s what Marcella
learned from her teachers—and
that’s what she continues to do
every day.
Jake Josef ’08 first came to PSU
as a singer. But everything
changed when he took a job in
the theatre shop. He was taken by
the hands-on nature of the work,
which includes all the design,
building, rigging, and technology
that go into the behind-the-scenes
work of a theatrical production.
He was hooked—and quickly
changed his major.
	 “Jake is a great example of
what it means to be a theatre
practitioner,” says Matt Kizer,
head of MTD’s theatre design and
technology program. “He began at
Plymouth State as a performer. He
sang, he danced. He performed
the lead role in our production
of Guys and Dolls. We admit stu-dents
by audition only here; Jake
was a really good performer. At
the same time, he also developed
an interest in theatre technology.
He worked in our shop, and grew
to be really good at engineering,
design, and planning.”
	 Josef keeps in touch with the
MTD faculty and still turns to
them for advice. “It was a small
program, which was a huge
influence on what I was able to
accomplish,” he says. “The fac-ulty
and the facilities at Plymouth
State are something that you’re
going to take with you and use for
the rest of your life.”
	 In 2007, Josef interned at
the Glimmerglass Festival, a
professional summer opera
company based in Cooperstown,
NY. That experience inspired
Josef’s decision to continue his
education. His appreciation for
the opportunities he’d had at
Plymouth State led him to seek
out another small program for
his MFA in technical direction
at Southern Illinois University
Carbondale. As a graduate
student, Josef was hired as
assistant technical director at
Glimmerglass, then promoted to
technical director. Last summer,
the technical team built sets for
three out of the four productions.
Building the set for Wagner’s one-act
opera The Flying Dutchman
“really stretched my knowledge,”
Josef says. “With flying actors
and lots of flying scenery, it was a
great learning experience!”
Josef’s work with
Glimmerglass has even taken
him around the world to Oman,
where he was technical director
for The Music Man, co-produced
with the Oman Royal Opera.
“The most rewarding part of
the trip was the chance to work
with theatre technicians from all
areas of the world, and learn their
methods and techniques in tech-nical
theatre,” Josef says. “The
opera house was state-of-the-art,
and the opportunity to work
with that kind of technology was
invaluable.”
	 Kizer is pleased to see where
his former student’s career has
taken him. “As a technical direc-tor,
Jake is ultimately in charge
of everything that happens on
stage in regard to technology
and stagecraft. He’s a great
representative of what we want
our program here to be about;
everyone should know as much
as they can about everything, and
put that together with their pas-sion
to contribute to our art.”
Kathleen Pantos ’08 assumed
she would attend college
in New York City with a highly
competitive dance program like
the one she had trained in. But a
friend told her about the dance
program at Plymouth State and
she decided to audition here,
as well. What she found at PSU
amazed her: a true sense of com-munity,
something she had been
missing in her earlier dance train-ing.
People on campus greeted her
wherever she went—even other
dancers. “Going into the city, you
get the competitive thing imme-diately,”
Pantos explains. “But at
Plymouth State, you get the sense
that we’re all doing this because
we love dance.”
She also found she could have a
full and rich life outside of dance
plus incredible professional oppor-tunities.
“The experiences we were
given in New Hampshire were just
as good as the ones my friends had
in New York or Los Angeles.”
	 Pantos speaks highly of
Amanda Whitworth, director of
the MTD dance program. “She’s
so supportive and she taught me
so much,” Pantos says, including
how to pace herself and how to
have fun. “She wants to see her
students succeed.”
	Whitworth speaks highly of
Pantos, as well. “Kat’s maturity
and focus grew tremendously
over the course of her academic
career. Because she remained
open to guidance, Kat was able to
build an educational and artistic
foundation that broadened her
choices upon graduation.”
One of those choices was to
go to Boston Dance Alliance’s
open-call audition for Urbanity,
a professional contemporary
dance company in the South End.
By 2011, Pantos was Urbanity’s
associate director, running the
apprentice program and summer
internships, and a principal dancer.
Another choice was to leave
Urbanity to work with the Sobers
and Godley Festival at Alvin
Ailey City Group Theatre in New
York City. Pantos even started her
own pick-up company, perform-ing
at the Genesis Dance Festival
in Queens. The Women in Dance
Festival pairs 10 up-and-coming
female choreographers with
famous female choreographers
to create new work. “Once you’re
out of college, you lose that sense
of mentorship. I was really drawn
to this festival because of the
mentorship aspect.”
	 Pantos remains connected to
PSU and MTD. “The community
Plymouth State has created fol-lows
through even six years later,”
she says. “I adore Plymouth. It’s a
home away from home. Amanda
creates a wonderful atmosphere
of ‘we’re going to work hard,
but we’re going to have fun.’”
In October, Pantos returned to
the Silver Center to conduct a
master class. “I’m excited to work
with the next crop of artists at
Plymouth State.”
Daniel Brevik ’11 had no idea
that he would be an opera
singer until an injury ended his
high school football career. A
friend suggested Plymouth State’s
vocal performance program,
and Brevik decided to audition.
When he saw MTD’s production
of Cabaret in the Silver Center
the night before his audition, he
knew he was at the right place. At
first, he sang mostly traditional
American pop and joined the a
cappella group, Vocal Order. His
experience with classical music
was minimal. “The first year was
pretty intense,” Brevik says, “but
I ended up falling in love with
Chamber Singers.”
One moment I’m singing a cappella and the next I’m singing opera, and it’s all
because of the professors I met along the way.
20 Plymouth State University ■ plymouth.edu
	 Brevik was advised to study
with Professor Kathleen Arrechi,
coordinator of voice performance
studies. He was surprised to be
accepted into her popular and
busy studio. “Professor Arrechi
makes sure that she gets you on
the right track,” says Brevik.
	 Arrechi recalls, “When I first
heard Danny sing, I knew that his
was a voice of exceptional prom-ise
but he really didn’t recognize
it himself. When I mentioned to
him that opera might be a direc-tion
he should consider, he was
very dubious. It took several years
of convincing, plus the assistance
of other knowledgeable singing
professionals, before Danny
started to believe this could hap-pen
for him.”
	Arrechi signed him up
for the American Traditions
competition, where he won the
People’s Choice Award and met
renowned operatic baritone
Sherrill Milnes. Milnes and
Arrechi encouraged him to enter
the Boston National Association
of Teachers of Singing (NATS)
Competition, where he took first
place and caught the attention of
bass-baritone Mark St. Laurent,
chair of the voice faculty of the
New England Conservatory.
Arrechi helped Brevik prepare
his audition for NEC’s gradu-ate
program. He knew it was a
competitive program and didn’t
expect to be accepted, much
less receive the conservatory’s
Presidential Scholarship.
	 Conductor Steven Lord has
been called one of the 25 most
powerful names in opera. He cast
Brevik in La Perichole and Paul
Bunyan. EDGE Boston’s review of
La Perichole, says, “Daniel Brevik
… was the real standout. His is
a world-class voice, a massive,
focused baritone with a rich,
warm timbre. He can look for-ward
to a major career in opera.”
	 Lord encouraged Brevik to
audition for Opera Theatre of
Saint Louis. “It’s one of those
programs you don’t expect to get
in,” Brevik says. But the audition
went well and Brevik found him-self
in St. Louis, in the ensemble
for Pagliacci and The Pirates of
Penzance. Brevik figures he must
have made a good impression
when he showed up on the first
day of rehearsal with all the chorus
parts memorized and discovered
that everyone else was sight read-ing.
Next June, Brevik will appear
in an original opera at the Opera
Theatre of Saint Louis called 27.
The opera will star acclaimed
mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe
as Gertrude Stein. Brevik was cast
to play several members of Stein’s
circle, including Pablo Picasso and
Ernest Hemingway. Composer
Ricky Ian Gordon will tailor these
roles specifically for Brevik’s voice.
Brevik marvels at his trans-formation
as a singer, and the
support from his professors at
PSU as a student and now as
a successful alumnus. “One
moment I’m singing a cappella
and the next I’m singing opera,
and it’s all because of the profes-sors
I met along the way.”

In September 2003, Plymouth State
University launched its criminal
justice program with 45 students
and two faculty members: Professor of
Business and Criminal Justice David
Kent (now professor emeritus) who
developed the program, and Mark
Fischler, who had recently joined the
faculty at PSU after working as a prac-ticing
defense attorney with the New
Hampshire Public Defender.
The goal of the program was to
fill a critical need in central New
Hampshire and beyond: to provide a
criminal justice degree that was geared
toward service, and whose graduates
would serve with compassion and a
willingness to help.
In just over a decade, the criminal
justice program at PSU has flourished,
with more than 300 majors and a large
and diverse faculty comprising current
and former attorneys, judges, police
CRIMINAL
JUSTICE
officers, parole officers, prison war-dens,
sociologists, and well-respected
researchers. “We have a committed
faculty that cares about students and
treats them like family,” says Fischler.
He notes that the faculty’s diverse back-ground
gives students “a well-rounded
exposure to the criminal justice system
that allows them to find a place where
they can make a difference.”
Professor Francis Williams, who
began teaching after a 26-year career as
a criminal justice professional, agrees.
“We are an engaged faculty with our
own individual research interests and
experiences. What we have in common
is a devotion to providing a learning
environment for our students that
allows them to challenge themselves
and succeed academically and in their
future careers.”
THE CURRICULUM
The Bachelor of Arts in Criminal
Justice prepares students for careers
throughout the criminal justice
system, including law enforcement,
law, court administration, govern-ment,
criminology, corrections and
probation, and careers working with
juveniles. In addition to acquiring
skills and knowledge in areas such
as forensic science, criminology,
ethics and law, research methods,
corrections, and criminal justice
technology, students also acquire a
strong liberal arts foundation that
helps them develop skills in problem
solving, communication and writing,
and interpersonal relations. “Criminal
justice is a people business,” says Kent,
who is also a judge with the Plymouth
Circuit Court. “You need strong com-munication
skills and interpersonal
skills to work in this field.”

faculty that cares
about students and
treats them like family,”
says Professor Mark

the criminal justice
department. Jeremy

Every class is interactive and
collaborative, which has helped
me become a stronger speaker
and more confident in sharing
my point of view.
22 Plymouth State University ■ plymouth.edu
As Fischler points out, the degree
offers more than the acquisition of
practical skills. “We value a liberal arts
education and the deeper world views that
are developed when you study through
the lens of a liberal arts education,” he
says. “It’s a great benefit to our students
who will go on to enforce the law,
interpret the law, work in corrections,
and serve people within the system.”
Walk into any criminal justice
classroom, and you won’t see a faculty
member lecturing while students
diligently take notes. Rather, active
student participation is expected,
and the students wouldn’t have it any
other way. “We often get into some
exciting discussions and debates in
class that make me want to read more,
learn more, and investigate certain
topics further,” says Charles DeJoie ’14.
“Every class is interactive and collab-orative,
which has helped me become
a stronger speaker and more confident
in sharing my point of view.”
Faculty members often invite
guest speakers to talk to their classes.
“Bringing professionals into the class-room
to present to students, share their
real-world experience and insights, and
answer questions is invaluable to our
students’ learning,” says Williams,
who also shares his own experiences in
law enforcement, security administra-tion,
and probation with his students.
Not only do these talks reinforce
classroom learning, he says, but they
also give students an idea of the kinds
of careers available within the field of
criminal justice.
Hands-On Learning
Like all majors at PSU, criminal
justice students engage in experiential
learning to supplement what they’re
learning in class. From observing
hearings and interviewing attorneys
and judges at the Plymouth District
Court to developing the skills neces-sary
to maintain and analyze criminal
evidence, criminal justice majors have
rich and varied hands-on learning
opportunities to choose from.
In Fischler’s Criminal Adjudication
course, for example, students fill
out search warrants and arresting
affidavits, and put their classroom
knowledge, communication skills,
and critical thinking skills to the test
by staging mock bail hearings, plea
negotiations, and cross-examinations.
In Professor Stephanie Halter’s ’02
Research Methods class, students
learn to become better consumers of
research and create their own surveys.
Some of Halter’s students are currently
working on a service-learning project
in which they are developing a survey
for the Plymouth Mental Health Court,
a program that seeks to provide an
effective and meaningful alternative to
the traditional criminal justice system
for individuals with mental illness. The
aim of the survey is to measure program
participants’ success in complying with
court orders, such as participation in
counseling, drug or alcohol treatment,
or finding employment. The survey will
also measure participant recidivism as
well as the participant satisfaction with
the program.
“Students will have the opportunity
to sit in on hearings and interact with
the program staff to learn more about
program goals and objectives, then
develop the survey,” says Halter, whose
doctoral dissertation on how juveniles
involved in prostitution were conceptu-alized
by police as victims or offenders
earned the American Professional
Society on the Abuse of Children’s
Award for Outstanding Doctoral
Dissertation in 2009.
Research
Research is a central part of Plymouth
State’s mission and a reflection of the
University’s values and guiding prin-ciples.
Many of the faculty members
in the criminal justice department
engage in scholarly research that they
share with their students, not only to
augment classroom learning, but also
to inspire them to discover their own
passion for research.
Halter acknowledges that many
of her students don’t immediately
recognize the value of research to
careers in criminal justice. Her most
compelling argument is her own
outside research endeavors, one
of which is conducting evaluation
research for the Court Improvement
Project, a statewide initiative that seeks
to improve the court experience for
abused and neglected children.
“Evaluation is a key part of the
criminal justice system, and I am paid
very well to do evaluation research,
because many agencies don’t know
how to do it themselves,” Halter says.
“They are spending taxpayer dollars on
programs and they need to make sure
these programs are effective. I tell my
students that if they don’t learn these
skills, they should be prepared to pay
a consultant about 10 percent of their
program’s budget someday, because
that’s what it costs for an evaluation.”

Professor Kristine Levan’s research
focuses on criminal violence and
institutional corrections, in particular
prison sexual assault and how it
impacts individuals in the long term
and how they take those experiences
with them when they’re released
back out into the community. Prison
inmates, says Levan, “are being released
from prison with sexually transmitted
diseases, rape trauma syndrome, hos-tility,
anger, fear, and depression, and
they’re continuing that cycle of violence
and victimization in the community or
at home. We need to put the ‘correcting’
back in ‘corrections.’”
Like many of her colleagues in the
criminal justice department, Levan’s
research is widely published in journal
articles, books, and textbooks. Her
most recent article, featured in Justice
Quarterly, focuses on perceptions that
male inmates have about sexual vic-timization
and why they don’t report
it, versus why people in the community
don’t report sexual victimization.
Other articles have analyzed media
depictions of sexual violence in the
prison system.
In 2011, Levan and her PSU col-league
Professor of Criminal Justice
David Mackey collaborated on Crime
Prevention, a textbook that is being
used in crime prevention classes and
criminology classes nationwide. She
followed this up with 2012’s Prison
Violence: Causes, Consequences, and
Solutions, a comprehensive analysis of
prison violence on national and inter-national
levels.
Internships
Internships give students the opportu-nity
to explore career options, develop
skills, and network with professionals
while applying what they’ve learned to
the real world. Criminal justice majors
with a grade point average of 3.0 and
higher are eligible for internships begin-ning
their junior year. Students have
interned at the US Marshal’s Office,
the state attorney general’s office, in
juvenile probation and parole, and in
police departments throughout the
region. “Internships allow you to engage
in hands-on learning that can help
shape your interest in a specific area
of the field, or in a specific profession,”
says Penina Wallace ’13. “I did two
internships, one with a criminal defense
law firm and the other with a nonprofit
drug abuse prevention program.”
While Wallace found both of her
internships interesting, it was her
internship with the law firm that
showed her where her interests lie. “I
was going to court, doing research,
interviewing clients, and experiencing
the daily activities of a lawyer. It helped
me develop an understanding, while
still a student, of what being a lawyer
would entail, and I loved it,” says
Wallace, who is now in her first year of
law school at UNH Law.
“An internship is just as successful
if you find out what you do not want to
do,” says Fischler. “That’s just as helpful
an experience, if not more so.”
Amanda Johnson ’08 knew exactly
what she wanted to do with her
criminal justice degree. “My goal was
to become a New Hampshire state
trooper after graduation,” she says. The
experience she gained and the con-tacts
she made during her internship
helped her do just that. “I completed
an internship with the Plymouth area
prosecutor’s office, and not only was
the experience invaluable in terms of
exposing me to the complex criminal
justice process from courtroom for-malities
to legal processes, but it also
provided me with an opportunity to
network with professionals in the field.
At the conclusion of my education at
Plymouth State, I had built relation-ships
with mentors and supervisors
that helped me secure employment.”
As a New Hampshire state trooper,
Johnson’s responsibilities include
enforcing motor vehicle laws and
investigating criminal offenses includ-ing
violations, misdemeanors, and
felony-level crimes. She is assigned to
Troop F, which primarily serves rural
towns in the northern half of New
Hampshire—towns that don’t have
fully staffed police departments, or any
police departments at all. “The state
police take on the primary law enforce-ment
duties for these towns,” she says.
In the decade since the Department
of Criminal Justice was formed, the
program has produced well-educated
graduates who go on to rewarding
careers in law, law enforcement, cor-rections,
and more. In fall 2014, PSU
aims to launch the Master of Science
in Criminal Justice Administration,
which will help prepare professionals
for leadership roles in law enforcement.
While PSU’s criminal justice
alumni embark on a wide variety of
careers, what they share is a high-quality
educational foundation and
connections with committed and car-ing
faculty mentors that endure long
after graduation.

26 Plymouth State University ■ plymouth.edu
A business-focused professional networking program, a reception to connect Squam
Lakes-area friends with the Museum of the White Mountains and Center for the
Environment, a reunion of alumni who lived in one of the first off-campus houses, and
an ongoing series of alumni socials: gatherings like these help to build relationships
among participants and with the University, engage alumni and friends in the life of the
University, and raise awareness about plans for the University’s future.
These photos offer a glimpse into recent events organized by the President’s Council,
the volunteer group that works in concert with the President’s Office and University
Advancement to secure private support for Plymouth State, with collaboration from
members of the Plymouth State Alumni Association Board of Directors.
MAKE A PLAN FOR PLYMOUTH STATE
Think beyond your family … beyond your lifetime … and consider a
planned gift to support Plymouth State University.
The simplest and most popular planned gift is to include a provision
for Plymouth State in your will. By leaving a gift—large or small—in
your will, your generosity will have an effect far beyond what we can
imagine today.
Beyond an outright cash bequest, consider leaving other assets to
PSU, such as savings bonds, retirement plan assets, securities, real
estate, life insurance death benefits, closely held stock, or tangible
personal property.
We understand this is a personal and private matter, but if you’re
thinking about making a planned gift to Plymouth State, and would
be willing to let us know, we’d be delighted to induct you into the
Heritage Society, the donor recognition circle honoring those who
will support Plymouth State University after their lifetime.
FROM THE PRESIDENT’S COUNCIL
Reaching Out to Alumni and Friends

Brown ’81 at the inaugural Boston

second successful event was held in

for future gatherings.
To discuss these options or
to inform us of the planned
gift you’ve already made,

donor relations manager,

FROM THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION
STAY CONNECTED—GET INVOLVED
Have you been to an alumni gathering in your area? The PSU Alumni
Association has partnered with the Alumni Relations Office to host events
in Portland (ME), Portsmouth, Laconia, Meredith, Lebanon, Manchester,
Concord (NH), Waltham (MA), Boston, New York City, Norwich (VT),
and Baltimore (MD). We hope that one of these locations is close enough
that you might venture out and make an evening of networking with
alumni, catching up on happenings at your alma mater, and learning about
opportunities to get involved.
Most recently, we’ve collaborated with Boston-area alumni to launch the
Plymouth State Boston Business Forum, with two events held so far. If
you’re a Plymouth State graduate working in business and would like to
join the growing Boston Business Forum list, send us a note at
alumni@plymouth.edu, and we’ll make sure you’re included.
In my conversations with alumni, I’m often asked about what happens at
these alumni networking events and how people can get involved. Here are
some answers to frequently asked questions:
I don’t know who’s attending the event. Can I bring a friend?
Of course! Call a classmate and use this as a reason to reconnect. Bring a
friend, whether they are a Plymouth State graduate or not, and come on out
to meet other alumni in your area.
What goes on at these events?
These events focus on bringing alumni together to encourage friendships
old and new. They’re a way to promote networking opportunities among
alumni, share news from campus, and invite alumni to stay connected and
involved by advocating for and promoting their alma mater. In addition,
we listen to what types of engagement opportunities you want, what you’d
like to hear about, and how you’d like to be involved.
Will I be asked to donate money?
While fundraising is a vital way that alumni show their support for
Plymouth State, and indeed gifts to The Fund for Plymouth State have a
significant impact on the student experience, these regional events are not
fundraisers. What we will do is proudly share updates about how gifts from
alumni are making a difference on campus and for students.
How do I find out about these events?
Keep your contact information, especially your e-mail address, current
with the Alumni Relations Office. If you move, change your e-mail
address, or have a new phone number, be sure to share your updated
information with us at go.plymouth.edu/alumni-update or call us at
(800) 772-7670. We post events on our website (plymouth.edu/alumni),
our Facebook page (facebook.com/plymouthstatealumni), include them
in A View from Rounds Tower, and send event e-invitations to alumni.

Music Robert Swift retired from Plymouth State in January
2013. Swift enriched the lives of thousands of PSU students
and local community members with his music appreciation
courses and involvement with the Pemigewasset Choral Society.
The Robert and Margot Swift Endowed Scholarship has
been established to honor and acknowledge the couple’s
commitment and contributions to the community choir and
to Plymouth State.
To make a gift in honor of Robert and Margot Swift,
please contact Diane Tiffany at (603) 535-2592 or visit
plymouth.edu/give-online and note Swift Endowed
Scholarship in the “Your Gift” area.

We’d love to hear from more alumni about
what Plymouth Magazine means to you.
Send us a note and a photo of you with your
copy to alumni@plymouth.edu and we may
share your story in an upcoming issue.
ince the first issue of Plymouth Magazine landed in readers’
mailboxes in 1996 (back when it was called Plymouth State
Update), it has made its way into the hands and hearts of tens
of thousands of alumni, students, families, friends, faculty,
and staff across the generations and around the world.
The magazine is a link back to campus, a trigger for a memory, an experience,
or a relationship. It communicates the University’s vision and goals, connects
alumni with the University and each other, and showcases the important
contributions that our students, faculty, and alumni make in their respective
communities.
Two recent notes from alumnae illustrate this.
Madeleine Goebel ’34, a Plymouth Normal School graduate who taught in
New Hampshire and Massachusetts, wrote: “I very much appreciate your
still sending me the Plymouth Magazine. I read every word and think you
are doing a fine job … My three years at Plymouth were cost-free except for
board because we were in a Depression. Now things are depressed again
but our children are borrowing so much money for college that it will take
years to pay back. Very sad! I taught forty years and in one more year I will
have been retired forty years. I think Plymouth Normal was a great school.
I bet you don’t get many letters from ninety-nine year old graduates … Your
efforts are appreciated!”
When Bich Tran ’08G received the Summer 2013 issue of Plymouth Magazine
at her home 8,000 miles away in Da Nang City, Vietnam, she was instantly
reminded of campus. “All the memories and my experiences as a PSU student
come back so clear and warm as soon as I touch it,” she says. “I am happy to
read the articles and catch up with news and achievements other PSU alumni
have gained. I always can go online and read and listen and watch PSU, but
the feeling of having the physical magazine in my hand is so amazing.”

basketball, field hockey, football, ice hockey, skiing, and soccer.
Inductees: Russ Massahos ’02, former four-year starting running back for
the Panthers who was a three-time Freedom Football Conference All-Star
and ranks third on PSU’s career rushing list; Tony Martinez ’01, former
two-time Little East Conference First Team All-Star power forward for
the Panther men’s basketball team who ranks fourth on PSU’s career
scoring list; Patrick McNamara ’86, former men’s skiing All-American
who captured national championships in slalom and combined alpine and
helped the Panthers to a national team title in 1985; Stephen Colonna
’99, former four-year veteran defenseman and two-year captain of the
Panther men’s ice hockey team and a two-time Eastern Collegiate Athletic
Association All-Star; Lilly Silva ’06, former two-time All-New England
star for PSU in field hockey who was a Little East Conference Player of
the Year and finished her career as PSU’s all-time leading scorer; and
Traci Walker Griffith ’91, former Panther women’s soccer star who set
numerous single-game, season and career scoring records and helped lead
the team to four NCAA Tournaments.

showing off his original class ring
with its finders, John and Tim Byrnes.

visible engraving.
“In the summer of 1973, a friend and I were tossing a football around in knee-high water at
Lake Sunapee State Beach,” recalls Randy Hoidahl ’74. “The ring was quite tight on my finger; but
when I went to catch a pass, the point of the football hit right at the base of my ring finger, and the ring
flew off into the lake.”
Hoidahl was never able to find the ring and eventually resigned himself to ordering a replacement.
Eight years later, an 11-year-old Tim Byrnes and his father, John, had traveled from their home in Keene,
NH, to spend the day metal detecting at the same beach. Father and son were about 15 feet offshore
when their detector signaled an object. There, in three feet of water and buried under five inches of
sand, they found a ring. They brought it home and put it in a box where it sat, forgotten, for 32 years.
Tim Byrnes, now in his forties, and his father had just picked up their metal detecting hobby again
when they rediscovered the box containing the Plymouth State class ring. “My dad and I knew that we
needed to try and return the ring to its owner,” says Tim. On June 19, 2013—two days before Alumni
Reunion Weekend—Tim posted a message on the PSU Alumni Association Facebook page.
All it took was a photo, a few clicks of the mouse, and a phone call to Hoidahl to confirm that it was,
in fact, his missing ring.
Exactly forty years after Hoidahl’s ring flew off his finger and into Lake Sunapee, the trio met at the
Byrnes’ home where father and son presented Hoidahl with his long-lost class ring.
“I think about the ring being underwater that amount of time and then sitting in a box for 30 years,”
says Tim. “It was a great feeling to see the ring finally home.”
Of the entire experience, Hoidahl says, “It was rather strange because it was something that was gone
from my life, an experience that I’d forgotten about. I’d bought the substitute ring. That Tim and John
found the original ring—and the way in which it was found—it’s just amazing that my ring has finally
found its way back to me.”
Coincidentally, Hoidahl will celebrate his 40th class reunion at Alumni Reunion Weekend June 20–22,
2014. “It’s hard to believe that it’s been 40 years. I’m looking forward to coming back.” And will he be
wearing his original class ring? “First I’ll have to get it resized,” he says, “It’s been 40 years and my fingers
are a little bigger than they used to be!”­—

BUILDING ON OUR LEGACY OF INNOVATION
TO INSPIRE THE NEXT GENERATION
OF EDUCATORS AND THEIR STUDENTS
Tom and Liz Kelsey are not New Hampshire natives, and neither
attended Plymouth State. But their roots in the Lakes Region run deep:
As a boy, Tom spent summers on Squam Lake with his family and he later
attended Dartmouth College. Those experiences made New Hampshire a
part of his being.
Tom and Liz met, married, settled in New Jersey, and soon started
a family. Wanting their three children to experience life beyond the
surroundings of their New Jersey home, the Kelseys took them to Squam. Ten summers at the Rockywold-Deephaven Camps in Holderness led to the
1980 purchase of a small lakeshore property followed by more than three
decades of wonderful, summer memories.
Several years ago Tom and Liz retired and are now full-time NH
residents. They spend summers on Squam in a new home they built while
their grown children and their families come and go, staying at the original
cottage; through that New Hampshire has become an important part of the
lives of the next two generations.
The Kelseys care deeply about their adopted state. After a 1997 visit to
Gorham where they learned about the socio-economic challenges of the
North Country, they knew they wanted to help. They began supporting
organizations that provide resources and education to North Country
families. “We feel blessed by what we’ve been given, by what we have, and
we wanted to give back,” says Liz. “And the North Country needed help.”
The Kelseys became acquainted with Plymouth State through their
connection to Squam Lake. They attended events on campus, met
members of the PSU community, and came to appreciate PSU’s important
role in the region. “Plymouth State has a strong legacy, but has not rested
on its laurels,” says Tom. “It offers programs that are oriented to careers
that are viable in the North Country; it has an incubator that helps create
business opportunities, outstanding facilities, athletics, and more. PSU
offers much to students at a reasonable price; however, we recognize that
it may be beyond the means of some, and affording college is a real barrier
for those students.”
This connection between PSU and the North Country and the Kelsey’s
commitment to the region, led them to create the Thomas &amp; Elizabeth
Kelsey North Country Scholarship in 2016. The Scholarship supports
undergraduate students from New Hampshire, with preference given

scholarship recipients, both of whom hail from the North Country, began
their collegiate careers at PSU. “Being NH residents is a wonderful way to
spend our retirement years,” say Liz and Tom. “We are very pleased to have
the opportunity to support to PSU and hope that others may be inspired to
do the same.”

Excellence in
Educational Leadership
A Plymouth State University Tradition
Talk to anyone affiliated with Plymouth State University and you’re likely to hear a common refrain: “At Plymouth, you’re a face, not a number.” Nowhere is this truer than in the University’s undergraduate and graduate degree programs in education. “If you want to be anonymous, you can be for about two weeks and then you are part of the family,” says Cheryl Baker ‘97MEd, ‘05CAGS, ‘11EdD, a graduate teaching lecturer and interim director for the Holmes Center for School Partnerships and Educator Preparation at the University.
Plymouth State is justly proud of the strong sense of community shared by its education alumni, an attitude that springs in part from the University’s rich heritage in the field. The institution’s commitment to the teaching of teachers dates back to its founding in 1808 as Holmes Plymouth Academy, a pioneer institution for teacher training. In 1927, the American Council of Teacher Colleges evaluated Plymouth Normal School and granted it a Grade A rating as a teachers college. Nearly a century later, that rating still stands.
“You can’t ignore our history,” says Gail Mears, Dean of the College of Education, Health and Human Services. “We began as a laboratory school for teaching—the town’s school was on our campus. From the outset, we embraced a hands-on approach to educating our educators, with great attention to pedagogy, and that attitude has been a hallmark of Plymouth State ever since.” This student-centered approach is what makes Plymouth such a remarkable institution for educating educators, Mears notes, and in many respects, the introduction of Integrated Clusters is more aptly described as a natural progression in the University’s proud legacy than a new way of teaching.
A Commitment to Excellence
Because of its strong commitment to teaching, Plymouth State has made, and continues to make, an indelible mark on the state’s educational landscape. The numbers say it all; in any given year, over 40 percent of all school administrators in New Hampshire are Plymouth State graduates. And for those currently enrolled in the College of Education, 36 percent of the graduate students and 12 percent of the undergraduates are in a program that leads to certification.
These students enjoy access to a diverse education preparatory unit that encompasses bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees as well as a certificate of advanced graduate study (CAGS); a multiplicity of programs from early childhood to higher education; and numerous multi-disciplinary contacts with community partners around the state. With the introduction of Integrated Clusters, asserts Mears, these relationships will only become more robust. “Integrated clusters will put us in version 2.0,” she observes.
Through Integrated Clusters, continues Mears, faculty will not only be able to explore education issues across the region in greater depth, but also consider ways that the University can partner with schools around the state to meet the demands placed on educational institutions. “New Hampshire’s education system is facing challenges —particularly in economically strapped areas—so it’s exciting to explore ways in which Plymouth State can assist these communities. It’s incumbent on us to think about how we prepare our students, and by extension K-12 students, to look beyond the four walls of the classroom when addressing the real-world issues they’re likely to confront.” Faculty are constantly seeking ways to link concepts and practical applications, Mears notes, and the Integrated Clusters model will only make this process stronger. “The forthcoming opportunities for enhanced bi-directional relationships between the University, surrounding communities, and our school partners are incredibly exciting.”

A Marriage of Theory and Application
Such collaborative relationships are a powerful tool for experiential
learning, and a benefit that is amplified by Plymouth State’s size. With a combined undergraduate and graduate student body of just 927, education faculty and students get to know one another well, thereby
ensuring that students are able to obtain an education that speaks to their needs and interests. “Our programs are distinguished in no small
measure by the caring and thoughtfulness demonstrated by everyone
involved,” says Baker. One example of the college’s commitment
to students, she adds was the creation of a student chapter of the
Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD).
“Plymouth’s ASCD student chapter was the first in the state, and it’s incredibly important because it allows students to start networking with people who are doing what they aspire to do.”
Mike Whaland ’06, ‘08G, ‘13CAGS is one of many alumni who feels
strongly that he has benefited from the education and networking opportunities afforded him at the University. “Plymouth State does
a great job of fostering connections while also offering students a
valuable sense of autonomy,” notes Whaland. “During my time as a
student, I built close bonds with the faculty and with other students,
which enhanced my knowledge of the educational environment here in New Hampshire and made me more effective as an administrator. The University offers students a nice marriage of best practices and
educational philosophy coupled with practical experience.” Currently the Assistant Principal at Lancaster Elementary School in
Lancaster, NH, Whaland is the perfect example of the engaged, life-long learner commonly found within the education department’s alumni
body. He is presently pursuing his doctorate in education at Plymouth;
is a teaching lecturer at the University; and, together with Lancaster
Principal Todd Lamarque, was recently awarded a grant by the New
Hampshire Charitable Foundation’s Neil and Louise Tillotson Fund
to design and build a living laboratory on Lancaster’s school grounds
to “increase science content knowledge to existing educators through
collaboration with Plymouth State University.”
Whaland and Lamarque’s project offers a prime example of Integrated Clusters at work, uniting Lancaster K-8 educators with faculty from Plymouth State and personnel from Squam Lakes
Natural Science Center to develop innovative methods for teaching
the more abstract principles of Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Mathematics (STEM). Lancaster teachers will be trained to teach STEM topics with the principles of permaculture—agricultural
ecosystems designed to be sustainable and self-sufficient. Their efforts
will culminate in the design of a bio shelter greenhouse at the Lancaster
School that will serve as open laboratory for teaching STEM topics.
Another example of Integrated Clusters in action is Plymouth State’s nascent Lancaster Initiative, a project that brings together
faculty and more than 60 PSU students from 10 different
disciplines—adventure education, art, business, communications,
graphic design, health promotion, languages, marketing, travel,
and tourism—with Lancaster, NH business leaders and community
groups to address community sustainability. Working in a series of seven client-based teams, students are exploring ways to stimulate
“We began as a laboratory school
for teaching—the town’s school was
on our campus. From the outset,
we embraced a hands-on approach to educating our educators, with great attention to pedagogy, and
that attitude has been a hallmark of

entrepreneurial ventures and attract young professionals to this small North Country community, with a specific focus on multi-use planning for the historical Lancaster National Bank Building. Simply put, the initiative offers students a valuable opportunity to apply knowledge gained in the classroom to real-world problems.
The University focuses on teaching students to network and integrate into different domains, says Whaland, something he believes is very wise. “Learning isn’t done in isolation—as an educator, you always need to be thinking about how learning relates to the wider world and how to translate your skills outside the classroom. Plymouth State does a great job of fostering connections and giving students the autonomy they need to grow. I got a job right out of my master’s program and I felt very prepared to walk into my role in a public school.”
Now on the other side of the table, Whaland says he continues to be impressed with the level of preparation he sees in new Plymouth State education graduates. “When I encounter teachers who have trained at PSU, I know before we even begin talking that they will possess a strong foundation in the fundamentals and be on top of best practices in areas such as common core and assessment. I’m also confident that they will walk into their classrooms with practical experience under their belts. PSU grads are very good at hitting the ground running.” Based on information received from school administrators working with Plymouth State College of Education graduates, says Cheryl Baker, the University’s graduates are very knowledgeable. “They’re content driven, they’re well versed in the standards, they know how to develop curriculum, and they know how to take direction.”
A Seamless Continuum of Learning
“Plymouth State is a wonderful place to learn,” observes Whaland. “The professors are very close to their students. They get to know them as individuals, so they know how to support them, as well as how far and how hard to push them, and when to apply that pressure. You don’t get lost in the weeds. You have so many people looking out for you—your professors, your advisors—that you can’t hide, and that’s a good thing!”
“In the graduate school, coordinators go out of their way to make sure that students get what they need,” agrees Baker. “We create programs that meet the rigorous standards that education follows while also honoring the needs of the individual.” The University’s CAGS program is a perfect example. Some students complete the certificate in a couple of years, while others take four to five years to work through the program.
And to ensure that education graduates stay up-to-date with ongoing opportunities after leaving Plymouth, faculty make it a point to stay in touch, offering support and advice as needed. “Even though I graduated in 2013, I’m still in touch with a number of my professors and know that I can reach out to them any time I’m in need of guidance,” says Whaland. “As educators, we use the term ‘educational community’ quite a bit, but Plymouth State really has created a network of peers and mentors in which everyone strives to be the best. The University fosters an ongoing sense of community among its graduates that is second to none.”
In the end, it is that sense of community that has brought Plymouth State full circle, from its earliest days as a laboratory school—one in which students carried classroom knowledge into real-world situations —to its current iteration as an institution comprised of Integrated Clusters and open laboratories. Students continue to join theory with application, building on individual strengths to create unique paths to learning and perpetuate the school’s founding motto, Ut prosim “That I may serve.”

On June 6, 2017, The Wall Street Journal named Plymouth State University among the top schools in America for students to learn critical-thinking skills that prepare them to enter their careers as leaders in their chosen fields.
The front-page story detailed how few U.S. colleges teach their students how to think. According to the article and the statistics citied in the story, PSU ranked number one for critical-thinking improvement.
PSU ranked first among public colleges and universities across the country for its ability to improve the critical-thinking ability of students. The June 6 report showed that PSU far outpaced well-known public institutions including, University of Kentucky, University of Texas, Ohio State University, Keene State, and The Citadel.
The full story can be found at www.unionleader.com/article/20170608/NEWS04/170609456
“We were delighted to receive validation that our focus on critical thinking and attention to student development was reflected in these national rankings,” said Gail Mears, dean of the College of Education, Health and Human Services. “The results suggest that our students’ critical-thinking skills develop significantly over their time here. These results are not surprising given our unprecedented engagement with students, high-quality teaching, and a curriculum that emphasizes critical thinking.”
As PSU continues the move to the Integrated Clusters model of education, administrators are confident these critical-thinking skills combined with real-world experience will serve students well as they enter the world as PSU alumni.
Plymouth State’s continued move toward full implementation of the Integrated Clusters and open labs model took a leap forward as the first students moved into the Merrill Place Conference Center &amp; Residences on August 30, 2017.
The seven-story, 95,000 square foot building allows PSU to further integrate our academic cluster model into the living-learning experience for students. Offering 288 beds, Merrill Place offers students a state-of-the-art place to live and experience the clusters learning model outside the traditional classroom.
In addition to being the premier residence hall on campus, Merrill Place also serves as the center­piece to PSU’s growing conference and events department. With full-service conference facilities and on-site, hotel-style housing, Merrill Place will assist Plymouth State in growing our summer confer­ence business and have a direct, positive impact on the regional tourism and economic development.
The official ribbon cutting for the new facility will take place at the start of Homecoming Week­end 2017 on Friday, September 24 at 4:30 p.m. at Merrill Street.

OF NOTEKayleigh Bennett was ready to fly her small-town coop of Meredith, NH and follow her dreams to the big city in pursuit of her education. She enrolled in the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston, because she was determined to become an artist with an eye for business. But, like any great story, Bennett’s included an early plot twist. Disappointed with the direction of her program and feeling somewhat marginalized, Bennett transferred to PSU in the spring of 2015, her sophomore year, after learning about the possibility of creating her own major.
Now a rising senior, Bennett is set to graduate in 2018 from Plymouth’s Interdisciplinary Studies Program with a focus in marketing and creative services. Bennett counts her decision to transfer as one of the best she’s ever made. What Bennett lacked early in her collegiate adventure, she found in spades at Plymouth State. “As a transfer student, I quickly became part of the community,” says Bennett. “People at PSU take time to know the students and make it easy to find a home.
Home indeed. Bennett is a community advisor, orientation leader, member of the Interdisciplinary Studies honor society, and was recently tapped to serve as PSU’s student representative to the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees. ■ Lisa Cramb

the Hotel Room

ALUMNI SPOTLIGHTJason Zube ’97 is sitting in the lobby of the Samuel O’Reilly Bed and Breakfast, scrolling through his iPhone while waiting for a shipment of curtains to arrive. At 6 feet and 230 pounds, tattooed from the neck down, Zube isn’t a button-down business owner. But in two months, he’s made his newly renovated bed and breakfast one of the highest rated in the North Conway region. He credits his success in hospitality to his early success as a tattoo artist.
Although a successful and in-demand tattoo artist in Massachusetts, Zube struggled to find funding to launch his own tattoo studio space. Being turned down numerous times and feeling judged for having tattoos, Zube was reminded of an old book he read in high school, The Painted Bird by Jerzy Kosinski.
The title of the book is drawn from a moment in its story in which the protagonist, a young boy living in the midst of World War II, watches as a bird keeper takes one of his birds, paints it a different color, and releases it back in search of its flock, only for the bird to be viciously attacked by its kind. “It was an analogy to people being judged for what they look like rather than who they are,” Zube says. “It left an impression on me. Being heavily tattooed, I am used to people having an impression of me before they actually know me.”
After months of searching for a loan, Zube decided to visit one more bank. As he walked in, one of the bankers happened to recognize Zube from his early professional wrestling days, and agreed to meet with him. The meeting went well, and the business was launched. Zube opened his new tattoo shop in North Conway, and he named it The Painted Bird. Over the years, traveling tattoo artists from around the world were invited to The Painted Bird tattoo studio to feature their work and then stay the night in the renovated basement of Zube’s house. It wasn’t until a customer left one night that Zube had what he calls his 'aha moment.
“My customers had to drive home often very far after a late night session, and they were totally exhausted,” Zube says. He decided to extend his basement offer to the customer that night, and later began conceiving ways he could incorporate this into a new business.
With the flood of customers Zube had at The Painted Bird, he opened a new location. He used the second location as an opportunity to rebrand his business: The Boston Tattoo Company. After fourteen years, the two locations were fully staffed, which gave Zube a chance to return to the bank.
“They saw that I had paid off the initial loan years before it was due,” says Zube, “And when I came to them with a new idea, they partnered with a New Hampshire bank in order to get it done.”
Twenty years ago, Zube never thought he would own a bed and breakfast. “I never thought a lot of things would happen,” he says. “But sometimes you need to get to one place in order to see the other.” Today, Zube’s unique bed and breakfast and tattoo parlor combination, christened The Samuel O’Reilly House, which he co-owns with his Plymouth State fraternity brothers, is the only one of its kind in the area. And despite its niche market, business has been booming ever since its doors opened in May 2017.
“The hotel is finally open and is starting to pay for itself,” Zube says. While reflecting on moments that made the years of struggle worth it for him, Zube was reminded of the Fourth of July weekend in 2017.
“I had my entire tattoo staff up here for my birthday,” shares Zube. “Many of them would see the hotel for the first time. We had perfect weather kayaking down the Socko, and it was the first time both worlds collided. Everyone got to see a different side of me and had nothing but nice things to say.”
In the last 15 years, Zube has purchased two houses and opened three businesses. But the most rewarding part of it all was finding those who were willing to accept him, tattoos and all. Zube notes that it took sacrifice to get to where he is, and it often meant personal sacrifices.
“I sacrificed a lot of my relationships for my career,” Zube says, noting his gratitude for his current girlfriend’s support. “It’s hard to find someone who understands that sometimes work comes first when it’s all on you.” But despite any void he may be left with, Zube has no desire to settle down yet.
“I don’t like the word settle. It always sounds like you’re not getting what you want,” Zube adds. “I am really happy where I’m at in life. For every big peak, there’s been a valley.”
Jason Zube would like to thank Plymouth State and his fellow alumni for the memories he made here. “It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I cherish all the good people I’ve met and the good times that I had there,” Zube states. “If you’re reading this and happen to be in the area, please stop by and say hello. The doors are always open.”

PSU’s visionary approach to education is tearing down academic silos and creating seven interdisciplinary academic clusters that promote an integrated educational experience. The Integrated Cluster approach prepares students to be 21st century marketplace standouts and builds real-world collaborations between the University, industry, and communities.
At the core—the heart—of each cluster is the critical need for Open Laboratories: transformational spaces for students and faculty to engage with businesses and communities and apply their classroom experiences to solve challenging problems. For the Health and Human Enrichment (HHE) cluster, the Open Lab is the AllWell Complex on the Holderness Campus. The University plans to build new and upgrade current facilities at ALLWell to integrate academics, athletics, and outreach.
“This exciting strategic initiative lets us maximize the benefit of PSU’s splendid natural resources,” says Don Birx, president of Plymouth State University. “The new, world-class facilities will enable students to develop their academic and athletic prowess, while linking outdoors, indoors, tourism, health care, sports, hands-on learning, and regional economic growth. Thanks to the New Hampshire State Legislature, Plymouth State will receive $3 million toward the construction of this Open Lab.”
Upgrades of the AllWell Complex feature:
•
Two artificial turf playing fields to extend outdoor activities year-round
•
Stadium seating and lighting to expand outdoor operational hours
•
Six tennis courts to replace courts that were eliminated with the
construction of ALLWell North
•
Grass field enhancements to improve the fields’ longevity
•
Strength &amp; Conditioning Open Lab to be co-located with
the stadium and turf fields
Recruitment and Retention
Among PSU’s high-level priorities are recruiting and retaining top students, particularly those who are committed to active lifestyles. PSU’s lack of turf fields is a huge challenge in attracting first-class student athletes in all sports.
Benefits of artificial turf fields:
•
The University estimates that 90% of all students will use the stadium and turf field for academic instruction as well as recreational, intramural, and club sports.
•
PSU’s construction of facilities supporting ice hockey and track and field, for example, ushered in large enrollment increases. PSU projects similar increased enrollment with the new facilities and upgrades of the ALLWell Complex.
•
The turf fields will serve as Open Laboratories for academic programs and will be located immediately adjacent to the Strength and Conditioning Open Lab.
•
Turf fields offer top-quality playing surfaces year-round.
•
One-third of student athletes enrolling at PSU graduated from high schools with turf fields. To competitively recruit these potential PSU students, the University needs similar facilities at the collegiate level.
•
Without a turf field, PSU is unable to host NCAA playoff games. Field hockey teams practice and compete off-campus because they cannot play on grass. Similarly, the lack of a turf field rarely allows spring teams to host home games.

Atmospheric Rivers
PSU Meteorology Students Integrated Skills
Across Disciplines to Address Water Extremes in the West
12 Plymouth Magazine | Fall 2017
PLYMOUTH, N.H.—Undergraduate and graduate meteorology students are acquiring and applying new skills that will improve forecasting for extreme precipitation caused by atmospheric rivers (ARs). This research project reflects PSU’s move from a traditional academic model to Integrated Clusters, giving students the combination of interdisciplinary learning, collaboration, and hands-on opportunities they need to compete in an increasingly complex and interdisciplinary world.
Atmospheric rivers are corridors in the atmosphere where water vapor is channeled from one location to another in large-scale weather systems. Depending on the climate, ARs can result in deadly flash flooding, landslides, and blizzards. Although atmospheric rivers develop in New Hampshire and all over the globe, California is a prime location for the research study, because ARs account for nearly half of the Golden State’s total rainfall, and cause about 80 percent of its major floods. In 2017, the state has already weathered a number of major storms triggered by ARs that produced record-setting Sierra Nevada mountain range snowpack, rainfall, and flooded coastal riverbanks and rural towns.
Effectively managing all that water during the dry months as well as the extremely wet ones has been challenging for the state, which employs hundreds of reservoirs to regulate water supply.
The PSU meteorology student-researchers, led by Assistant Professor of Meteorology Dr. Jason Cordeira ’05, an expert in forecasting precipitation extremes, and Assistant Professor of Environmental Science Dr. Amy Villamagna, who specializes in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), aim to develop tools to better forecast the timing, duration, and intensity of extreme precipitation events to inform California’s reservoir operations. GIS is a mapping system that helps users analyze data to understand relationships, patterns, and trends.
“The idea of forecast-informed reservoir operation is, if you can trust that it will not rain during the next two weeks you should not release water from the reservoir. If you’re expecting several inches of rain during the next two weeks, you could release water so the reservoir isn’t overwhelmed,” explains Cordeira.
The research is being conducted on the PSU campus in the state-of-the-art Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute in the Boyd Science Center.
According to Villamagna, GIS adds a new dimension to the research, allowing students to gather a broader range of information. “Our students are learning more than just how much rain is going to fall and where, but also what will happen once the water hits the ground,” she says. “With that data, they can measure the effects of ARs on watersheds, reservoirs, cities, towns, people, and policy. The students are learning a new and marketable skill—GIS—and applying it to a real phenomenon that has on-the-ground impacts.”
The PSU team’s research is funded by a four-year, $379,000 grant from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in collaboration with the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, which is one of the oldest and largest centers for ocean and Earth science research. The partnership between Scripps and PSU was established in 2013 and has led to several research opportunities involving undergraduate and graduate students and jobs at Scripps for recent PSU graduates Brian Kawzenuk ’15G and Chad Hecht ’16G.
Cordeira believes it is the interdisciplinary nature of research at PSU that helped the University secure this latest grant and helped Kawzenuk and Hecht land jobs in their field immediately after graduating. “This grant comes at an opportune time when the University is moving toward a more interdisciplinary, integrative approach. This project includes elements of social science, computer science, atmospheric science, and environmental science and policy,” he says. “I think that was part of the appeal to Scripps when they decided to both fund this project and hire our graduates.”
Cordeira and Villamagna expanded their research team during summer 2017 in which one graduate student and three undergraduate students led interdisciplinary projects that aim to improve the understanding of forecasting extreme precipitation and its impacts over California.
Allison Young ’16G, a recent graduate of the M.S. Applied Meteorology program and one of the students on the research team, said her integrated and interdisciplinary research experience at PSU will give her an edge when she enters the workforce. “No Earth science exists on its own; they’re all connected,” she says. “All of the natural sciences are coming around to this idea that students and researchers need diverse skills to solve a problem. Thanks to this project, I feel like I’m already ahead.”

The Beebe River flows 16.7 miles from Black Mountain Pond in
Sandwich, NH before joining the Pemigewasset River near the town
of Blair. As with all rivers and streams the Beebe River is home to all
manners of aquatic life, but thanks to the Beebe River Restoration
Project, a Plymouth State Clusters Initiative, this summer the river
is also home to Plymouth State University students, faculty, and
researchers.
The river is home to wild eastern brook trout, which thrive in
cold waters, and the Beebe’s undeveloped tributaries offer prime
spawning ground and a cooler habitat when the main river warms
in summer. Road crossings along the Beebe and its tributaries are
currently managed with culverts beneath the road’s surface. However, low stream flow (as observed during the dry summer of 2016) and
culverts blocked with natural woody debris can prevent the trout from reaching or returning from the streams.
The goal of the Beebe River Restoration Project is to restore natural
hydrologic flows into the river by replacing the culverts with bridges and removing barriers allowing fish passage. It sounds simple, but it is a complex project with many moving parts, implications, and a
dedicated team of professionals, students, and volunteers making it happen.
PSU was introduced to the project in early summer of 2016 when
Tyson Morrill '18, a volunteer with the New Hampshire Fish and
Game Department who monitorted trout along the river, became a
graduate student in biology at PSU. As part of his graduate program,
Morrill designed a plan to study the Beebe River brook trout
population pre-and post-restoration.
The PSU Cluster Initiative team consists of two Plymouth State
faculty members, two graduate students, four undergraduate students,
and an alumn; Amy Villamagna, Ph.D., assistant professor of environmental science and policy, Brigid O’Donnell, Ph.D., associate professor of developmental biology, Tyson Morrill, graduate student
in biology, Katerina Crowley, graduate student in environmental
science and policy, Samantha (Mac) Bevier, environmental science
and policy major, Zach Newcity, environmental science and policy major, Griffan Nyhan, environmental science and policy major, Nick Scola, interdisciplinary studies major, and Jared Lamey ‘17, BS,
Biology. The PSU team is working alongside NH Fish and Game to electrofish or “shock” the water, making it possible to tag and collect
data on the trout population. After tagging, the team will temporarily
relocate fish when construction gets underway to avoid any negative interaction. Volunteers from Trout Unlimited Pemigewasset Chapter, often as many as 20 or more, regularly pitch in to help the team with tagging and data collection. In addition, members of the PSU
community and community-at-large have often waded into the Beebe to lend a helping hand.
The entire restoration project is spearheaded by Nancy Bell,
Vermont and New Hampshire director of The Conservation Fund. According to Dr. Villamagna, Bell is the catalyst who makes the whole operation happen.
“It is a great partnership and truly integrated project,” says
Villamagna. “The way all groups are working together in concert to make it happen is amazing.”
Plymouth State is responsible for the scientific aspect of the project. The team is currently gathering data to determine the state of the fish population and general health of the river pre-restoration.
Once the culverts are replaced and natural stream flows are restored,
PSU will continue tracking and monitoring fish, monitoring macroinvertebrates, wildlife and fauna along the river, and analyzing
data to determine the health of the river. Morrill’s graduate studies, co-advised by professors O’Donnell and
Villamagna, will take him through the pre-restoration phase of the
project, while another graduate student will continue post-restoration.
Beebe River as an Open Laboratory
The PSU team’s work this summer was funded through a cluster
grant from the Tourism, Environment &amp; Sustainable Development
cluster. In addition, Nancy Bell has submitted a grant application
to The Conservation Fund to help support and expand PSU’s
involvement going forward. “Our vision is to eventually use the Beebe River watershed as an outdoor classroom for undergraduate and graduate students from the sciences, policy, and geography departments, as well as history, art,
and other programs,” says Villamagna.
“This is a long-term project with great opportunities for PSU
students to get real field experience,” adds Morrill. “The Beebe parcel
is ten minutes from campus, which makes it easily accessible. And
having the chance to work in the field with people from various
organizations and the community creates a true open lab—it’s
exciting.”
Samantha “Mac” Bevier, one of the undergraduate students
working on the project, credits hands-on opportunities such as this as
a primary reason she transferred to Plymouth State University. “I want to do the research, not just hear about it in lecture,” says Bevier. ■ Lisa Cramb

Plymouth State University’s Music, Theater, and Dance Department, and future Arts &amp; Technology Cluster, is the “creative heart” of campus. Theatre’s development and resulting success can be attributed in part to the late Dr. Roi M. White, the man who, quite literally, built PSU’s performing arts program from the ground up. From being a kid who was “born in a trunk” to two stock theater actors and receiving no traditional schooling outside of the theater circuit until high school, to building a highly respected theater program and receiving an honorary doctorate, White epitomized the notion that hard work and passion pay off. As Dr. Charles R. Duke ’62 noted in an article at the time of White’s retirement, “If the theater is magical, Dr. Roi White … is a magician who made it come alive.”
Between 1951 and 1978, White established one of the finest collegiate theater programs of its kind and became widely recognized for his work. Much of this recognition was thanks to the Plymouth Players student performance group he established. Early in the group’s existence, as Professor Jim Hogan (PSC 1953-1986) mentions in his book Plymouth—Where My Viewpoints Crossed, “The Players, along with the Boston University School of Theater, were singled out of all the academic theaters in New England as doing ‘pioneering work’ in the training of school, theater personnel.”
The Players started without a significant budget allowance, so they built sets in the basement of Rounds Hall and performed in a small lecture hall. Dr. Charles R. Duke noted at the start, “All that [White] had were enthusiastic students, but those, in his opinion, were quite enough. He had to borrow tools from the maintenance department to build stage settings, and chairs and a table from the local hotel for props.” Despite these initial challenges, the Plymouth Players grew into a professional-level performing group that produced shows across the region, drawing crowds by the hundreds.
“In a college with no theatre majors, and no formal drama department, Plymouth emerged as an almost mythical creator of theatrical magic in the Northern hinterlands,” recalls Terry Lorden ’66, a former Player who later worked with White to establish the American Stage Festival in Milford, New Hampshire. “A kind of cult, a good cult, naturally formed around Roi’s creations. Audiences from some distance, but also theatre-devoted, mature performers, artists, photographers, set builders, wardrobe collectors and re-creators, and historians became working members.”
In the years following its creation, the Plymouth Players emerged as the face of Plymouth for the New England region. This centrality in the public’s eye was an unplanned, yet magnificent development for the Plymouth Teachers College (PTC) and Plymouth State College (PSC) communities. Performing an exceptional four major shows per year, the group wowed audiences with works of Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Eugene O’Neill and many of theater’s other notable playwrights.
White not only instructed the Plymouth Players through their productions, but created the set designs, lighting configurations, and various aspects of the period costuming required for each play. With such immense passion and work ethic, there was no better man to take on that challenge. In White’s own words, this enthusiasm stemmed from genuine love for his job: “I have liked my work so much. I have been pleasantly surprised that I have been paid to do it,” wrote White. This sense of commitment extended beyond his productions to include his many students, as well. White didn’t want to simply give his students an education; he strove to provide them with experiences. Through their work in Plymouth State Theatre, and grueling apprenticeships on the summer theater circuit, many of his students found a passion.
In his instruction, White challenged his protégés to push their limits. He strongly believed in the hidden potential of his performers, particularly those that were more reserved. He found that some of his best students came from people who were quiet or shy, and said that his greatest joy was “to see people blossom, to see them successfully express themselves, and to build something inside that shows through in their lives.”
Working with the students of PTC and PSC was one of White’s most significant passions. Many of his students from the Plymouth Players went on to become educators of the arts, and professionals on the theater circuit as actors, directors, stage managers, and set builders. His dedication proved to be infectious, as his students often worked as hard as he did, giving their best efforts to the craft, developing and refining their theater skills along the way.
Commenting on White’s dedication to his students, Larry Presby ’58 remembers that “as the Plymouth Players’ Director, White never failed to make rehearsals a teaching time, as well as requiring perfection in performance.” White’s remarkable accomplishments in building an exceptional theater program, his commitment to his students, and his passion for the theater led to his award of a Doctor of Humane Letters Degree by PSC and the University System of New Hampshire in 1972. The honorary degree is awarded to those who are outstanding educators and leaders in their field. There was no more qualified recipient for this honor than Dr. Roi White. As Duke said, “the honor was richly deserved because it was for much more than producing plays. It was recognition for a man who had devoted his entire life to bringing the theater to life for people.”
White retired from PSC in 1978, but continued his work in the theater until his death in 1984. Today, his legacy lives on in the creative culture of PSU. His legendary Plymouth Players endure, still performing on campus. During his tenure, White inspired a close-knit community of innovation, passion, and creativity that remains central to the core values of Plymouth State University to this day.
A Creative and Innovative Soul:
Remembering Dr. Roi M. White and the Plymouth Players
16 Plymouth Magazine | Fall 2017
ARTSBarbara Demmett Webb, Class of ’65, acted under the direction of Dr. Roi White at Plymouth Teachers College (PTC) and slowly
found a path into theatre, first via community theatre and most recently into local professional theatre productions. Since moving
to Plymouth, she’s performed with the Papermill Theatre at Jean’s Playhouse in Lincoln as well as the Winnipesaukee Playhouse in
Meredith.
Webb was comfortable with the stage from an early age; singing, dancing, and performing before women’s clubs, grange halls
and veteran’s hospitals. She then dabbled in theatre a bit in junior high and helped back stage for her senior play in high school. When Webb saw a posting in Rounds Hall during her freshman year at PTC she decided to audition. She was cast by Dr. Roi White
as Muriel McComber in Eugene O’Neill’s Ah, Wilderness! and in many subsequent productions, including The Torchbearers and The
Merchant of Venice while studying to become a teacher.
“I learned valuable acting skills from Dr. Roi White and enjoyed my time as a Plymouth Player very much,” says Webb. “I have
fond memories of those times.”
The stage door reopened for Webb at the age of 45 when she performed in a community theatre production of Crimes of the Heart,
and it has not closed since. She learned of numerous community theatres in New Hampshire and kept an eye out for auditions. Her
passion is evident as she performs in one play after another, despite the rigor of learning lines and traveling to rehearsals. “Commu-
nity theatre requires a lot of work and a lot of travel time, but it also provides a lot of pleasure,&quot; shares Webb.
The prestigious New Hampshire Theatre Awards began in 2002, and seldom has there been a year when Webb didn’t receive a
nomination. She was selected as Best Actress in Community Theatre both for August: Osage County and for The Dining Room and as Best Supporting Actress for Blithe Spirit. She is very proud to have been one of the top five finalists for Best Supporting Actress in Professional Theatre in 2015. She and her husband, Gordon who is the men’s lacrosse coach at PSU, moved to Plymouth in 2007. She
immediately became involved with the Educational Theatre Collaborative (ETC) and has performed in four of their recent produc-
tions. She says performing with ETC helped her meet people in Plymouth and the surrounding area. In her first ETC show in 2008 she was surprised to meet up with a local thespian, with whom she had shared the stage at PTC 45 years before.
Her list of things she had planned to do while in retirement remains predominantly untouched. “This theatre hobby has changed
all that,” says Webb. ■ Besty Cheney '89 '99G

Plymouth State is practically embedded in Sue Smith’s DNA. It’s part of her family’s legacy, which began when her grandmother, Phyllis Shepard
Smith, graduated from Plymouth Normal School in 1926. It is an understatement to say that the rest is history. A 1981 graduate of the University of New Hampshire, Smith earned a master’s degree at Plymouth State while working on campus in the late 1980s—
first in admissions and later as Director of Alumni Relations. All three of Smith’s children either attend or have graduated from PSU. Her daughters
Nathalie Smith Palmer ’17 graduated in May and Mackenzie ‘22 is an Interdisciplinary Studies major, with a focus on marketing and health; and her
son Baker ‘20 is a Fine Arts major. Mackenzie and Baker are commuter students, but “enjoy campus life as much as possible,” says Smith.
When Smith learned of PSU’s transformation to an Integrated Clusters model, she immediately recognized the possibilities for students, alumni,
and the community. As a lifelong local resident and owner of Cottage Place on Squam Lake, Smith is active in civic and business organizations and
passionate about ensuring the region’s economic vitality. She is excited about what PSU’s Integrated Clusters approach means for the community
and for students like her children. She sees it as a win-win.
“Plymouth’s alumni ranks include successful businesspeople, many of whom live and work in this area,” says Smith. “Creating more opportunities to forge partnerships with these alumni and their businesses will be invaluable to students as they prepare for future careers, but also stands to benefit the region’s economy.” Smith always looks forward to greeting PSU alumni and friends at Cottage Place on Squam Lake.

YOU’VE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IN YOUR CAREER
AT BANK OF NH. HOW HAS YOUR CAREER RISEN SO QUICKLY?
Success is measured in many ways. While I feel I have been successful in many aspect of my life, there is always more to achieve. I feel that my career has progressed quickly as a result of determination, having the right career for my personality, and by surrounding myself with the right people.
I have always been determined in life which has been a strong attribute to my success. I tend to set small, fast-paced goals along the path to a much larger goal. Once completed, it is time for something new. Always stay busy, never be bored and don’t be afraid of change. Change is inevitable and sometimes hard,but your biggest strength is in learning to adjust.
At an early age, I became an entrepreneur, running a lemonade business at the local fairs and festivals, which provided me with the skills to do many things but most importantly made me realize what components of a business I loved to do. Every job has certain tasks you prefer to prioritize over others but identifying what it is you like most and ensuring that is the majority of your daily job, you will enjoy your work and the chal­lenges you encounter. You should always look forward to going to work each day and I do.
ARE THERE ANY “KEYS” TO YOUR SUCCESS?
Yes, I feel there have been many components to my success including hard work, focus, communication and dedication.
HARD WORK – You should always do your best and exceed expectations upon every opportunity.
FOCUS – You always need to have a goal in mind and stick to it.
COMMUNICATION – Anticipate what will be asked, be thorough and responsive.
DEDICATION – Be committed and loyal to yourself, your job and your peers.
I have been fortunate to have a boss who recognizes, appreciates and rewards all of these “keys.”
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PART OF YOUR JOB?
My favorite part is working with people, co-workers and the community. It is rewarding to assist others, and I am grateful to be assisted. We learn from each other every day.
WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE TO WORK WITH PSU AS A PROFESSIONAL?
In my role as Public Relations Officer for Bank of New Hampshire I have been fortunate to work with Plymouth State University on many levels. It gives me great pride to partner with them to further the expansion of the University and programming in a giving capacity and to benefit from their charitable efforts to the many civic and nonprofit organizations within the Plymouth community.
HOW DID YOUR EXPERIENCES AT PSU HELP YOU BECOME SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR CAREER?
I would consider myself a nontraditional student due to transferring schools three times in four years. This in itself was a huge learning experience although I do not recommend it. I transferred to Plymouth State University for the beginning of my Junior Year. The transfer to PSU also brought me “home,” which I realize now was where I belonged all along. As a senior in high school and myself as the sole source of financing for my education, I decided against all advisement to stay local and moved to Charlotte, NC where I would know very few people and pay out-of-state tuition. That lasted one semester and I moved to Providence, RI where it was a reasonable distance from home. Although this was less than a three hour drive home, the private school I decided to attend was more than I could manage to pay on my own and it still didn’t feel like the right fit for me.
Finally I decided to apply to Plymouth State, was accepted, moved home and loved every bit of my last two years earning my Bachelor’s degree. Going to Plymouth State not only taught me many valuable life lessons but attending classes that exposed me to real-life application of my major was eye opening and provided affirmation that the major I had selected was the right fit for me. While working to appropriately align my transfer credits I built a relationship with an advisor that became a source of guidance for my education and my future. They provided me with the tools I needed to succeed. I always felt like they were rooting for me as a student and as I reconnect on a professional level realize that it never stops. As an alumni they are proud to see and hear about all students that followed their dreams and are successful in various ways.
WHAT DOES PSU MEAN TO YOU?
Plymouth state is not just an education to me but is a place that I look at as a resource for the community.

15th President Donald Birx
The Best Job Perk Ever
Interview with former US poet laureate and writer Donald Hall p. 6
Building a First-Year Class
This fall PSU welcomed its largest incoming class yet. p. 4LIKE MOST TEENAGERS, ELLEN MACDONALD ’16 WASN’T PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN FOLLOWING IN HER FATHER’S FOOTSTEPS. When she was
looking at colleges, she purposely avoided his alma mater Plymouth State. “My dad dragged me here anyway,” she recalls. “And I ended up loving it!”
Steve MacDonald ’79 has fond memories of living in Hall Residence Hall,
hosting Winter Carnival events that united students across campus, and being
recognized with the Harold E. Hyde Award for his work with Student Senate.
“To me, Plymouth State was the greatest place in the world,” he says. That’s what he wanted for his daughter.
The friendly campus, caring faculty members, and excellent education Steve
always talked about when Ellen was growing up are exactly what have made
her years at Plymouth State so special. “I was very shy when I came here, and
I didn’t know what I wanted to do for a career,” she recalls. “Not only did I
meet my best friend in my residence hall and connect with great people in the
business department, but I also discovered my interest in professional sales.”
As a proud alumnus, Steve has donated to the Fund for Plymouth State in
support of the people and programs that make the University the special
place that it is. Now as a proud parent, he has made his most recent gift in
honor of Ellen, who will graduate next spring. “It’s nice that we’re both part of
something bigger,” he says.

Kaleb Hart ’11 photo.2 Plymouth Magazine | Fall 2015
After a nationwide search, it was quickly apparent to everyone that Don
was the best person for the job, an opinion that led to the unanimous
affirmation vote of the board of trustees. Don has a background that is balanced in both private and public
roles. Prior to beginning his academic career at New Mexico State
University at Las Cruces, he worked at Systems Research Laboratories as a vice president in charge of technology and new ventures. His private
industry experience will be especially valuable given the changing world of higher education. University presidents are expected to think more like CEOs and have a strong understanding of both the financial and
operational aspects of running institutions in highly competitive envi-
ronments. They must maximize the students’ academic experience while
delivering it at the most affordable price possible. Don has the experi-
ence, expertise, and drive to assure PSU’s long-term success. A creative thinker who works collaboratively with faculty and staff,
Don has already laid out a new educational approach (read more about it
on page12). As PSU looks to the future, the campus will be focused on
providing educational opportunities in interdisciplinary clusters. This
innovative approach, while continuing to build on PSU’s heritage of engaged scholarship and interdisciplinary learning, will allow students to take part in “open laboratories,” interfacing with faculty, alumni, external industry, and non-profit partners to create a robust learning
environment. Don shared this direction with the USNH Board of Trust-
ees, and his idea was met with great support and enthusiasm. Students, the region, and the state will benefit from creative solutions and scholar-
ship that will result from this cluster-based model.
Don strongly embraces aligning PSU’s strategic strengths with the
region and the state, which will allow the University to play an even
greater role in promoting economic vibrancy in the Lakes Region and
North Country. The board of trustees supports his vision that takes the traditional town-gown relationship to a new level by becoming a more
focused economic partner with community and business leaders.
These are exciting times at Plymouth State University, and the board
of trustees is pleased to have President Donald Birx leading the mandate
for change. We have great confidence in the collective abilities on cam-
pus to deliver a new model that reflects the university of the twenty-first
century—one that is focused on providing students with a first-class educational experience and being an economic engine that benefits the
region and state’s economy.
We wish Don a long and successful tenure and look forward to great
work from PSU!

ALISHA MEDEIROS ’15 WANTS TO HELP TROUBLED YOUTH
make better choices and live fulfilling
lives. This desire, influenced by a fam-
ily tragedy, led her to pursue a career
in criminal justice.
Medeiros was just 12 years old
when her sister, who was estranged
from her family, died of a drug over-
dose. “I always wonder what would
have happened if we could have talked to her,” she says. “I think she felt alone.”
The desire to help others who are struggling led Medeiros to Plymouth State, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice. She is now among the first class of students to enroll in a new Master of Science Degree in Criminal Justice Administration. The program is designed to provide criminal justice professionals with the skills they need to become effective leaders and administrators in police depart-
ments, correctional institutions, court systems, and other facilities. “There is a need for highly trained
professionals in our communities and
an advanced degree will help them become the leaders they need to be,” says Professor of Criminal Justice
Stephanie Halter ’02.
Derry, NH, police officer Patrick
Dawson ’09 agrees. He is pursuing the
master’s degree in criminal justice administration to make himself more marketable as an administrator.
And Justice for All PSU launches Master’s Degree in Criminal Justice Administration
Police departments may not require
advanced degrees of those seeking to become sergeants, lieutenants, captains, and chiefs, but Dawson says many departments, including his own, offer incentives to those who earn them. And several of those profession-
als in leadership positions in Derry, Dawson notes, hold advanced degrees.
Taking classes while working
full-time can be a challenge, therefore
the program is designed to accom-
modate the needs of busy working professionals. Courses are offered
online and face-to-face in Plymouth and Concord. There is also an acceler-
ated one-year program option, which
Medeiros is pursuing while working
as an advocate and caregiver to young
women with disabilities at a rehabilita-
tion center. After earning her master’s degree, she hopes to work at a juvenile
detention center and eventually in a restorative justice program.
In her current position, Medeiros is learning about herself, how she
manages her emotions, and how she
deals with challenges, all skills that
will be important to her future work in the field. She marvels at each small
improvement the women she works with make. “It’s such an amazing feel-
ing helping them learn skills that they will use for the rest of their lives.”

our target demographic—college-
age students—there was also increased competition among universities throughout New Hampshire and the region. This compelled us to reconsider our marketing and recruitment strat-
egies, and our admissions process. As the vice president for
enrollment management and student affairs, my role is to
help PSU navigate through these challenges. In the last year,
colleagues from across cam-
pus—Admissions, Information

The Class of 2019 already
has a variety of impressive and
unique accomplishments to its credit: these students are ser-
vicemen and women, certified seaplane pilots, videographers, world travelers, budding meteo-
rologists, and more. And with an average GPA of 3.01, this class is the most academically prepared incoming class yet.
A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND A DECREASE
in the number of 18– to 21– year-
olds in the overall population
have left colleges and universities across the country struggling
with declining under-graduate enrollments in recent years. When we examined our fall 2014 undergraduate student
enrollment, which at 800 stu-
dents was among our smallest incoming classes, we saw that while there was an increase in inquiries and enrollment from
students in New York and New
Jersey, other geographic markets
remained flat. With the decline in Services, Student Affairs, Athlet-
ics, and Academic Affairs—have
come together to help position PSU for recruitment success.
As a result of our efforts, we recently welcomed our largest
incoming class in the 144-year history. The Class of 2019 is more than 1,400 students strong;
about half of them come from New Hampshire, with the rest hailing from 25 other states and
15 countries. We welcomed 235 transfer students, the most we’ve
had in four years, thanks to dual admissions agreements with community colleges. Building a First-Year Class
PSU set a new record with its largest incoming class to date. Here’s how.

Change is good
PSU’s overwhelming success with enrollment for the 2015–16 academic year was the result of
focused multi-year investments in admissions, marketing, academic
and co-curricular programs, and
new and repurposed facilities. We raised PSU’s visibility in New England and beyond, increased our connections with prospective students through targeted and
personalized communication, and—because students who visit our campus are nearly three
times more likely to enroll—we offered more campus visits than ever before, and improved the
overall visit experience.
We also removed potential barriers in our admissions
process. Recognizing that standardized test scores hold little value in determining an applicant’s academic prepara-
tion, PSU was an early adopter
of a test-optional admissions
policy, a growing movement among colleges and universities nationwide. Applicants are free to choose whether to submit their
SAT or ACT scores along with the required admissions materi-
als, which include high school
transcripts, an admissions essay, and an academic recommenda-
tion. We continue to consider a student’s extracurricular activi-
ties, as well. Together, these items
present a comprehensive picture of our prospective students.
The Undergraduate Admis-
sions team and Information Technology Services created more efficient ways to apply to PSU, in addition to the Common Appli-
cation. The Panther Application
(for first-year students) and our
new transfer application stream-
line the application process and do not require an application fee. Retaining our students
We are ever mindful of the need to not only recruit students, but
also to retain and graduate the
students we have. To that end, PSU created a new position, the dean of the first-year experience, which provides leadership in assessing and enhancing first-
year students’ intellectual growth,
social development, and sense of
shared community engagement
and responsibility. The inaugural
dean of the first-year experi-
ence is Associate Professor of Criminal Justice Mark Fischler.
With this renewed focus on the critical first year of college, we will help ensure that our students’ first year is as successful and
fulfilling as it can be, and that
they will remain proud Panthers throughout their education here,
and beyond.
Looking ahead
Galvanized by our enrollment for the Class of 2019, we’ve set an enrollment goal of 1,550 for the Class of 2020; included in that
figure are goals for 230 transfer
students and 50 international
students. We believe these goals, while ambitious, are within our reach: this past summer we had a record number of campus visits and inquiries, and we’re already
receiving applications for next fall.
How you can help
To ensure our success, we need your help. Our alumni,
donors, and friends make the
best ambassadors for PSU. If you know of a great student
whom you think would thrive
in a rigorous and collaborative
academic environment in a
close-knit campus community surrounded by the natural
beauty of the lakes and
mountains, show your Panther
Pride by encouraging the
student to check us out at

A New Hampshire poet and author, Hall has had honors bestowed upon him by two US presidents: In 2006, George W. Bush appointed Hall the
14th US Poet Laureate, and in 2010, President Barack Obama awarded him a National Medal of the Arts. It may not be as prestigious, but I have an honor for him as well: “Best Job Perk Ever.” Within a few weeks of becoming
director of the Silver Center in 1996, I invited Don to read his poetry. Frankly, I wasn’t that familiar with his work, but there had been a lot of local
and national press about the death of
his wife, the poet Jane Kenyon, just the year before. I started to read both Jane
and Don’s poetry and quickly became a fan of both. While I loved Don’s
poetry, his essays on living at Eagle Pond Farm were like a guide to living in New Hampshire for me, a native
Southerner, so I read everything by him that I could get my hands on.
Around the time of his first read-
ing at Silver, he was beginning to write the collection called Without,
a book of poems dedicated to Jane Kenyon that earned him the L. L. Winship/PEN New England Award in 1999. His reading at Silver was one of his first after her death and was quite somber, as I recall. And it was abso-
lutely brilliant. Don had always been known as a powerful performer of his own poetry (which is not always the case with poets) but unbeknownst to me, he was considered one of the best. So on a sweltering summer night in the middle of August, with almost no advertising, the Smith Recital Hall was packed. After a few more readings over the next couple of years, we formalized our relationship and the Eagle Pond Authors’ Series was born. Eagle Pond Farm in Wilmot, New Hampshire, is the ancestral home where Don’s grandmother and mother were born, where he spent summers as a child, and where he and Jane Kenyon moved in 1975. For the past 18 years, the Eagle Pond Authors’ Series has celebrated great writing by some of the nation’s outstanding authors. The series has featured three US poets laureate: Maundy Mitchell photo.
The Best Job Perk Ever
An Interview with Donald Hall ■ Diane Jeffrey ’97, Director of the Silver Center for the Arts
When I tell people that I am director of PSU’s Silver Center for the Arts, they often say “That sounds like fun!” Not only do I confirm their suspicions, I often tell them about the fascinating people I work with and get to know. At the top of that list is Donald Hall. 8 Plymouth Magazine | Fall 2015
Donald Hall, Charles Simic, and Maxine Kumin; six Pulitzer Prize winners: Sharon Olds, Charles Simic, Galway Kinnell, Franz Wright, Jorie Graham, and Richard Ford; and five poets who have won the National Book Award: Robert Bly, Galway Kin-
nell, Ruth Stone, Mark Doty, and Jean Valentine. Many are lifelong friends of Don’s, some are acquaintances
from the poetry circuit over the years, and some are relatively new poets who can be a bit starstruck. I love watching their faces as Don intro-
duces them to the audience and talks about their work. His introduction is likely one of the highlights of their
professional lives. Don was born in 1928 in New
Haven, Connecticut, and started
writing poetry at a very young age. When he was just 16, he was accepted to the prestigious Bread Loaf Writers
Conference in Vermont where he met celebrated poet and former Plymouth Normal School faculty member
Robert Frost. “I remember meeting him [Frost]
several times on the softball field
or after his reading—but there was
one long visit. We sat on the balcony
outside the main inn, sitting down for a moment, when two women
approached us and we talked. It was a mother and her daughter... .
We probably talked for two hours, And now a crazy coincidence: the
mother was Dorothy Kunhardt,
who wrote Pat the Bunny. She was
Linda Kunhardt’s grandmother!
Linda was not even born yet.”
[Editor’s note: Linda Kunhardt is Hall’s companion and a poet herself]. Don is a graduate of Phillips Exeter
Academy, Harvard, and Oxford
University, where he graduated in 1953 and became the first poetry edi-
tor of The Paris Review. While there, he interviewed many famous poets including T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Just three years later, at the young
age of 28, he was already well known
enough to be appointed to a national committee by President Eisenhower.
“President Eisenhower started
a Person-to-Person Program, supposedly to connect Russians of any particular business to their American equivalent. When the
bunch came together, I quickly
figured out that I was ‘The Young
Poet.’ At the end of the evening
meeting, having come up with some silly proposals, the chairman of the committee decided that we would meet the next day … and
he suggested that the committee
to make the final suggestions
should be William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, and Donald Hall. Yes, I
was inhibited, but certainly, I was
flattered as well.”
For his poetry, Don received the Marshall/Nation Award in 1987 for
his book The Happy Man, both the
National Book Critics Circle Award
and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize
in 1989 for The One Day, the Robert Above: Eagle Pond Farm in Wilmot, NH, Hall’s ancestral home where he spent summers as a child, and later lived with wife, poet Jane Kenyon.

Frost Medal in 1990, and Ruth Lilly
Poetry Prize for Lifetime Achievement
in 1994. Don says that the ability to write poetry has abandoned him in recent years, so he focuses on prose these days. Last year he published Essays After Eighty, which climbed to number 18 on the New York Times Best Sellers list and met with glowing reviews. He just put the finishing touches on his latest collection, The Selected Poems of Donald Hall, to be published in December. “It was scary to look forward to
choosing the small Selected Poems.
It is probably one-fifth of the poems included in White Apples and the
Taste of Stone (a large, definitive collection published in 2006). The
old volume went out of print, and
in the meantime, I had become
ashamed of including so much. I
picked out my favorites—some are my favorites because other people
have liked them so much—and it was easier than I thought it would
be. I have had no second thoughts.”
It’s always interesting, I think, to hear an author share who he or she enjoys reading, and what projects he or she has in the works. Don Hall doesn’t
disappoint.
“I always read Thomas Hardy. I do not keep up well with what is newly published. I like [poets] Chris
Wiman, Henri Cole, and Spencer

prose, and continue to hope that it is good enough.” In 2008, upon the occasion of his 80th birthday, we had a small party for Don after his reading of a newly released book, Unpacking the Boxes: A Memoir of a Life in Poetry. At the end of the evening while he was still signing books, I looked through the items he received that night: a framed proclamation from the governor making September 20, 2008 “Donald Hall Day” in New Hampshire, a quart of Kentucky bourbon, a couple of books of poetry, an apple pie, and a small, brightly colored gift bag that contained the ashes of a man Don had never met. The man’s wife was a big fan of Don’s and she brought them as a present. Those are the birthday presents of one fascinating man.

ELIZABETH MORRISSETTE ’18 STOOD ON THE STAGE AT HER FIRST MISS NEW HAMPSHIRE PAGEANT, TRYING TO KEEP HER KNEES
FROM KNOCKING. “I was definitely nervous—I’d only had a week to prepare
and I wasn’t really sure what to expect—but at the same time I felt confident,” she says.
If you had asked this vivacious graphic design major a year ago if she could
imagine participating in a pageant, being judged on a showcase of talent,
personal interview, lifestyle and fitness, and evening wear, Morrissette would
have said “No way.” As a lifelong dancer—she minors in dance at PSU—she’s
used to performing. But a pageant? Still, when her dance teacher in her hometown of Manchester, NH, encour-
aged her to explore the opportunity as a way to earn scholarship money and
develop new skills, Morrissette reconsidered. In May she was crowned Miss University 2015, representing all of the University System of New Hampshire
institutions.
“A lot of the women had been involved in pageants for a long time, so it was
intimidating,” she says. But she found that people were supportive, and although she considered herself shy, she made many friends. Also, Morrissette says, “We’re
seen as public figures: Speaking to anyone and everyone is part of the job. I’ve definitely come out of my shell because of this program. I feel comfortable
talking to anyone now.”
Morrissette’s identical twin sister Erica encouraged her throughout the short
but intense pageant process, and was there to celebrate when she was named
Miss University 2015. This fall, the sisters started their sophomore year at PSU. “We’ve always done everything so similarly—we’re roommates, we’re graphic design majors, and we dance—this is the only thing I have that’s mine alone,”
Morrissette says. In addition to her studies and dance this year, Morrissette will represent the
Miss New Hampshire Program’s emphasis on service: participating in blood
drives, fashion shows for the elderly, PSU bingo nights, and fundraisers for a
girls mentoring program. “It’s been a great opportunity to get more involved in the community and in the state,” she says. After all, beyond the sparkle of the
pageant, the beauty of the Miss University Scholarship Program is in its align-
ment with Plymouth State University’s motto, Ut prosim (That I may serve).

Coach for a Day
New program gives professors an all-access
pass to Panther football
Dean of the First-Year Experience Mark Fischler is a professor, mentor, and friend to countless students. But this past September, he was also a
coach for the Panther football team.
As the first professor to participate in the new Coach for a Day program, Fischler spent time with the team leading up to its home opener against Castleton University (VT) and was on the sidelines for the big game.
From early mornings in the weight room and long, grueling practices, to
the inspirational and occasionally rowdy team meetings, he witnessed the dedication PSU student-athletes have to their sport. “I’ve had many student-athletes in class—to see what they are doing outside of their
academic experience was eye-opening,” says Fischler, who gave pep talks
to the team and feedback to the coaches.
Head football coach Paul Castonia developed the program to give
faculty a better understanding of what it means to be a student-athlete at
PSU. “As a NCAA Division III university,” he says, “PSU expects student-
athletes to give 100 percent in their studies and in their sport, and they do.
This program gives faculty the chance to see this firsthand.”
As an avid football fan, Fischler says his Coach for a Day experience was thrilling, especially on game day. “The energy was intense and
contagious,” he says. As an educator, he says the experience was invaluable. “It was an honor
for me to spend time with the team, interact with them, cheer them on
from the sidelines, and gain an appreciation for how our players and
coaches work together to represent PSU.”

Creating the Future Together A Conversation with PSU’s 15th President Donald Birx
■ Lori L. Ferguson WALKING INTO THE THIRD-FLOOR OFFICE SUITE OF PLYMOUTH STATE UNIVERSITY’S NEWLY
APPOINTED PRESIDENT, THE IMPRESSION IS IMMEDIATE: THIS IS A PLACE OF CREATIVITY AND VISION. Beautiful artwork by Plymouth State students occupies places of pride on virtually every surface—paintings and photographs adorn the walls
and three-dimensional ceramic pieces rest on pedestals scattered about the space. There’s a relaxed rhythm here,
underpinned by a quiet energy and a willingness to
explore new connections. As it turns out, the setting is a remarkably apt reflection of the new man in the corner
office: Dr. Donald Birx.
Birx is a soft-spoken individual with an easy smile and a barely contained excitement for the task at hand.
He holds a PhD in electrical engineering and an MBA in finance and has spent as much time in private industry as he has in academia. “I try not to let my industry experi-
ence get in the way,” he says with a wry chuckle. In reality, Birx observes, he has found his lengthy experience in both sectors to be a tremendous asset. “There’s a real need for universities to intersect with their surrounding com-
munities and the industries and non-profits therein,” he
asserts, “and having depth of experience in both business and academia helps me to see both sides of the equation.” In today’s fast-moving, highly interactive global economy, there’s a huge need to make sure students are equipped with the interdisciplinary tools and experiences to thrive,
Birx says, and this is precisely the goal that he has set for
himself as Plymouth State’s 15th president. Above: 􀀲􃈀􀁔􅐀􀁇􄜀􀁕􅔀􀁋􄬀􀁆􄘀􀁇􄜀􀁐􅀀􀁖􅘀􀀂􀈀􀀤􂐀􀁋􄬀􀁔􅐀􀁚􅨀􀀂􀈀􀁉􄤀􀁔􅐀􀁇􄜀􀁇􄜀􀁖􅘀􀁕􅔀􀀂􀈁􀆂􈈀􀁔􅐀􀁕􅔀􀁖􅘀􀀏􀼀􀁛􅬀􀁇􄜀􀁃􄌀􀁔􅐀􀀂􀈀􀁕􅔀􀁖􅘀􀁗􅜀􀁆􄘀􀁇􄜀􀁐􅀀􀁖􅘀􀀂􀈀􀀣􂌀􀁎􄸀􀁇􄜀􀁚􅨀􀁃􄌀􀁐􅀀􀁆􄘀􀁔􅐀􀁋􄬀􀁃􄌀􀀂􀈀􀀨􂠀􀁑􅄀􀁔􅐀􀁖􅘀􀁋􄬀􀁇􄜀􀁔􅐀􀀂􀈨

“I’m excited about what can be accomplished when we bring education and business together in innovative ways,” Birx observes. “The synergy is incredibly powerful and the
opportunities created are transformative—for ourselves, our students, and our community.”
Birx was drawn to Plymouth State, he says, for a
number of reasons, not the least of which is the region’s natural beauty. “Having lived all over the country, you get
a sense of what you like, and my family and I immediately
fell in love with both the location and setting of this place.” Birx, his wife, and four adult children enjoy such outdoor
activities as skiing, swimming, kayaking, and hiking, as well as an occasional trip to the city. “The geography here
is beautiful,” he notes, “and the remoteness is just right—
we’re close to the city, but not right in it.” Birx was equally taken with the University. “The
campus is beautiful, the quality of the faculty, staff, and
students is high, and the desire to be the best you can be is pervasive,” he says. “I want everyone to know how truly special Plymouth State is.”
Moved by the depth of talent and openness to new
ideas he encountered, Birx realized that Plymouth State’s desire to chart a new course into the future was a won-
derful fit with his own vision for creating the dynamic
learning environment that’s needed to prepare students for success in the twenty-first-century. He began his ten-
ure as president on July 31, and has already started on an ambitious path to success. Strengths across disciplines
Birx believes that the secret to making Plymouth State a model of the modern, twenty-first-century residential
university revolves around two seminal concepts: clusters and the open lab. “I started experimenting with the
concept of clusters in 1996,” he explains, “and after 20 years of working in these intersecting areas, I’ve seen how
powerful the concept can be and I know that Plymouth State is a place where the idea can be fully realized.” There
are many institutions across the country that have imple-
mented the cluster concept as a part of their programs, but
they are still heavily discipline-based overall, Birx notes. Few places have created a holistic relationship between
disciplines, the university, and the community in which
it resides based on the cluster and open lab model. This is the model that Birx envisions for Plymouth State.
The idea behind clusters is fairly straightforward, Birx explains. You pull together unique strengths across disciplines from the community, the university, and regional businesses and non-profits that complement core competencies within the university and sectors of opportunity globally. This creates a locus of education and activity that matches the challenges and needs of the twenty-first-century economy that graduating students will enter. Birx says it will allow PSU to be incredibly creative and to establish more programs that are leaders nationally and internationally. It also gives students broad areas of interrelated studies as well as discipline-
based majors from which to choose. Over the course of the next nine months, Birx plans to work closely with Plymouth State faculty and staff to define a series of five to seven clusters that build upon the University’s unique strengths, together with those of the communities within a two-hour drive of Plymouth. Art and technology, he says, offer a perfect example
of a potential new cluster. “The region within a two-hour driving radius of Plymouth—from the North Country
to greater Boston—is widely recognized as a very strong
arts region, and the arts are a core competency here at
Plymouth State as well. Technology is an equally power-
ful player in the region—Boston is a technology hub and
competency in this sector is critical for our students.” Therefore, Birx says, an arts and technology cluster is among those being considered. The arts are a key STEM field, though they are seldom thought of in this manner. The two disciplines absolutely complement one another. For example, the combination is critical in new product
design, advanced manufacturing, entertainment, infor-
mation presentation, analytics, modeling and simulation, and developing training scenarios—and the combination
offers platforms for individuals from education, industry,
and the community to work and learn together in highly
creative and meaningful ways. “Processes become
interlinked, feedback loops
develop, ideas and
concepts begin to intersect in a self-
reinforcing manner, and big changes
happen! The once
disparate slices of general education
and the world
around us become
themed coursework
within a clustered
framework. “
“I’m excited about what can be accomplished when we bring education and business together in innovative ways,” Birx observes. John McKeith photo.Plymouth State University | plymouth.edu/magazine 15
“My background is in complex systems and artificial
intelligence,” Birx continues, “so I’ve witnessed firsthand
the ways in which many different pieces can come together, creating an epiphany of discovery and energy where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Pro-
cesses become interlinked, feedback loops develop, ideas
and concepts begin to intersect in a self-reinforcing man-
ner, and big changes happen! The once disparate slices of general education and the world around us become
themed coursework within a clustered framework.”
The benefits of combining seemingly divergent strands of study through a cluster are further enforced through open labs—environments in which classroom learning is combined with hands-on exploration and real-world challenges through interactions across disciplines and among students, faculty, staff, alumni, and members of the community. Birx witnessed the potential for learning and development represented by open labs during his tenure at the University of Houston, where he co-founded the Center for Industrial Partnerships, as well as at Pennsylvania State University’s Behrend College, where he co-founded the Advanced Manufacturing and Innovation Center. “These centers were founded to provide pathways for members of the community to come in to open laboratory environ-
ments to work alongside students and faculty to create capstone projects, develop new product ideas, or solve challenges in their businesses. It quickly becomes not only an integrated way of learning but also one that is self-
perpetuating and entrepreneurial. Businesses and other
community organizations realize the value of educating students in this way and begin investing in departmental programs, work-study initiatives, design centers, and schol-
arships. Students recognize the benefits as well, gathering valuable knowledge through their coursework and then applying that knowledge and cultivating critical-thinking skills in real-world situations.” As a result, Birx says, stu-
dents graduate with a potent combination of education and practical experience that allows them to integrate knowl-
edge across disciplines and work successfully in a team environment to create things and get things done. “It is a more comprehensive experience than typical internships
and traditional student engagement opportunities.”
Birx says that he has also seen this experiential learn-
ing model bear fruit in hard dollars and cents. “When
I arrived at the University of Houston in 2006, the uni-
versity was collecting approximately $300,000 a year in licensing fees from collaborative endeavors between the
school and private industry,” Birx notes. “When I checked a year ago with my colleagues at UH, that number had
climbed to approximately $16 million per year, due in large part to the visionary leadership at UH and the
number of collaborative relationships between the univer-
sity and the community that were fostered at the Center
for Industrial Partnerships as well as in open laboratories based on clusters.” Individuals between the ages of 20 and 27 are at their
most creative and energetic, Birx asserts; what better way
to direct that energy than into educational initiatives and
experiences that will set the students up for success? “If
you look back in our history to the founding of the first land grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862,
you quickly realize the transformative power of bringing
universities, government, and business together to tackle
problems and move the economy forward—the intersec-
tion of knowledge and practice is incredibly powerful.” The public universities of the late nineteenth century were founded, Birx notes, to educate farmers, research the best methods for sustainable productivity growth in agricul-
ture, and train those coming out of a rural environment
to be leaders in the nascent industrial economy. The uni-
versities became the open laboratories where industry and
education met and where the barriers between research and practice, industry and academia, and learning and
doing were lowered. And the results were staggering. Within the century, the United States emerged as the world leader in agriculture and manufacturing. “We not only fed ourselves and our growing population, we fed
the world,” Birx says. “We not only made things, we were
the place to come for the latest in creative ideas.” Indeed,
he says, it’s estimated that 85 percent of our economic
growth came about as a result of our ability to create and
make things through technology and creative thinking
across disciplines. Even today when other countries talk about our future leadership in the global economy, it
always revolves around our creativity.
In the intervening years, the US has lost a bit of this edge, Birx observes, but he is confident that through a
return to a revitalized, twenty-first-century interpretation of the open laboratories concept for universities, we can
regain it. “When we all work together, the results are trans-
formative—we’ve seen it happen in our country before,
and we can see it happen again. My goal as president of Plymouth State University is to demonstrate how partner-
ships that capitalize on the synergy between learning and
doing can make a profound difference in our world.”
Once the ball is rolling, Birx continues, the benefits
quickly follow. The community becomes more involved with the university, the university prospers, local and
state governments recognize in a more substantive way
the relevance of higher education, and students receive
an education that feeds their interests and allows them to
make a positive impact in their communities.
“My goal as president of
Plymouth State
University is to demonstrate how partnerships
that capitalize
on the synergy
between learning and doing can

world.”

Working together
Alumni play a pivotal role in this process, Birx notes. They’re already living and working in the community
and can help to spread word of the University’s mission
as well as facilitate relationships between the school and their particular organizations. “Alumni are in the
community as business owners, legislators, volunteers,
donors, and employees, and they have firsthand experience with the University’s strengths and abilities, so they’re ideal ambassadors.”
Donors are another important constituency, Birx says,
and their involvement in remaking Plymouth State into
the university of the twenty-first century is equally criti-
cal. “Donors want to be part of creating something,” Birx says, “and when they see where their dollars can have an impact and make a difference, they’re energized. When
donors see the way in which clusters enable students to
obtain a strong foundation in the liberal arts together
with critical-thinking skills and real-world experience,
they’re moved to engage. Basing our educational model on the concept of clusters and open labs allows us all to
dream again about what we want to be and do, and it’s incredibly compelling and liberating.”
Plymouth State’s motto is Ut prosim (That I may serve),
Birx notes, and it’s one that he loves. “I think it really goes to the essence of what a leader should be about, and my mission is to give that motto focus. I want to challenge our
faculty, staff, students, and alumni to think hard about the
broad picture: ‘How might we best serve in this coming
century?’ ‘Who are we serving?’ I want Plymouth State to
continue to serve our community in a way that’s creative,
meaningful, and transformative.
“I truly believe that you can create the best thing in the
world, but if you haven’t done it in a way that enhances people’s lives and brings them together, what value is it?” Birx concludes. “I care about people and what they can
become, and I believe that we can achieve greater things
collectively than we can individually. Working together,
I know that we can position Plymouth State University as a role model for other institutions of like size. We can
provide an example of how residential universities can
partner with their communities to provide experiences
that are transformative—for ourselves, our students, and
the communities in which we live.”

SIXTY-SEVEN MILLION AMERI-
CANS HAVE IT. Nearly a thousand
people die from it each day. And in just one year, it can cost the nation more
than $40 million.
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, takes a tremendous toll on our coun-
try, both in lives and in dollars. And
as the population ages, these sobering
statistics are expected to increase.
But what if that trend could be reversed?
This question is at the heart of
Jennifer Dupont’s research. A postdoc-
toral research fellow in the Molecular
Cardiology Research Institute (MCRI) at Tufts Medical Center in Boston,
Massachusetts, Dupont is on a quest to
discover the molecular factors in aging that contribute to hypertension. “Life is about helping people,” she says. “I
happen to be interested in science, and I want to use that to help people.” Hope for Hypertension
Jennifer DuPont ’08 is investigating what triggers high blood pressure as we age
goal is to better understand how to
control blood pressure as we age and
identify innovative therapeutic drug combinations that will help reduce the
morbidity and mortality rates related
to aging-associated hypertension.”
DuPont earned her bachelor’s degree in exercise science and physiol-
ogy from PSU in 2008. An excellent
student and talented researcher, she
received full scholarships at the Uni-
versity of Delaware, where she earned both her master’s and doctoral degrees
in applied physiology. When she began
her search for a postdoctoral research fellowship, she focused on Boston,
which is home to some of the country’s
top research hospitals and close to her
family. Her fellowship at MCRI has
given her the opportunity to expand
her scientific skill set. “All of the research I did in graduate school was
clinical-based, working directly with patients, so I had very little molecular biology experience,” she says. “This
fellowship challenged me to step into a laboratory where I had to learn almost everything from scratch. It has been
an extremely rewarding journey.”
Rewarding indeed: already her work
has garnered awards and recognition
both nationally and internationally. Last January, she was honored with an American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship, a highly
competitive grant that helps to fund
her research. In April, she was one of
only 10 junior researchers worldwide to earn the American Physiological Society’s (APS) Cardiovascular Section
Research Recognition Award. She
also earned the APS’s Caroline tum
Suden Professional Opportunity Award, which recognizes promising postdocoral and medical residents. DuPont is already thinking ahead to her work post-fellowship. “In the
next year, I will be applying for several
competitive awards that will aid in my transition from a fellow to an independent investigator,” she says. “Ultimately, my goals are to have my own laboratory where I can continue
to study cardiovascular disease and
also teach and mentor students. I’ve
been fortunate to have had great
teaching and mentorship throughout
my journey as a scientist, and I believe
that passing that on to future scien-
tists, clinicians, therapists, and others is an extremely important aspect of my career and the path I have chosen.” ■ Barbra Alan

High blood pressure is the most common cardiovascular disease risk factor, and its prevalence greatly
increases with age, affecting roughly 60 percent of people over the age of 60 and 80 percent of the population over
the age of 80. “This is a huge public
health issue because current therapies
do not adequately control blood pres-
sure in half of patients over the age of 50,” says DuPont, who has been part of MCRI’s international team of inves-
tigators, physician-scientists, trainees,
and researchers since June 2013. “Our 18 Plymouth Magazine | Fall 2015

Hampshire, where she served as the director of parent programs. During her
13 years at Holderness School, Woods
focused on building leadership and
parent giving opportunities through the school’s annual giving program.
“I’ve already heard from many alumni that they value their Plymouth State education and want to help future genera-
tions of students experience all that PSU has to offer,” says Woods. “Annual giving is critical to PSU—the University is a better place because of committed alumni who make a point
of giving back and getting involved.”
Woods is a graduate of Gettysburg College, where she
received a degree in psychology and was a member of the
women’s varsity lacrosse team.

From Soldier to Veteran: A Passion for Service
FROM THE AGE OF 17,
when she signed up for
the Army National Guard’s basic training, Jessie Tustin ’15
has lived the Guard’s motto: “Always Ready. Always There.” Today, retired after nearly two decades of military service, Tustin continues to serve.
Fighting poppies with saffron Poppies may be Afghanistan’s
top cash crop, but Sergeant First
Class Carolee “Jessie” Tustin was determined to help Afghan farmers find an alternative to
the illegal production of opium. During a 2009–10 tour of duty in Afghanistan, Tustin worked making sure it was happening. That was pretty cool.”
Still, political, religious, envi-
ronmental, and economic con-
cerns made her task onerous. Opium production, usually
overseen by the Taliban, sup-
ports farmers’ livelihoods and
the national economy, so the eradication or replacement of poppy plants is controversial.
“I had a lot of people telling
me that I wasn’t going to be able to do what I did,” says Tustin. “But I ended up hav-
ing some amazing results and finding a niche for myself in coordinating and collaborat-
ing with people. I didn’t rec-
ognize that what I was doing
in Afghanistan was social work until somebody pointed it out to me later,” she says with a
laugh. “I loved it.”
Serving, post-service During her 19 years of service
in the Guard, Tustin found cre-
ative ways to use her skills to
make life better for the com-
munities in which she worked.
After an autoimmune disease caused by environmental exposure forced her to take medical retirement in 2013, she was ready to embark on a new adventure. Social work seemed a natural next step.
Over the years, Tustin has
watched military friends in the
Left: Tustin (in black hijab)

demonstration farm in Mehtar Lam, Laghman Province, the
capital of Afghanistan.

with a Bachelor of Science in Social Work in 2015. Kaleb Hart ’11 photo.
with local and federal organi-
zations to develop programs that provided women with
the skills to process saffron
and grow mushrooms: valu-
able crops that could replace
opium with an equivalent
value in the marketplace. “Our goal was to establish a rapport while respect-
ing the culture,” Tustin says. Afghans themselves would ultimately need to adminis-
ter the programs, so faculty were recruited from Kabul University to teach the work-
ers how to grow and process the crops. “It was Afghans training Afghans,” she says. “We were just overseeing and LGBTQ community struggle to
have their post-service needs met. Thanks to the legacy of
the long-standing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, accurate
statistics are hard to come by
about the number and needs of LGBT service members who
have accessed Veterans Affairs
for support and health care after their military service. But, as Tustin says, “There’s a need,
a gap there right now. My goal
is to work individually with vet-
erans to help them adjust to
civilian life, especially those in the LGBTQ community. I also want to work on a macro level
to bring together a support network for veterans who have
been treated differently in the service because of their sexual
orientation or the fact that they’re transgender.”
Always ready. Always there.
In her mission to help under-
served populations be treated with dignity and respect, Tustin’s commitment to the
code of the National Guard
endures. “I may not be in the
military anymore, but I will
always be a soldier,” she says.
“You want to believe there’s some sort of trickle-down effect to all the big social
changes happening today, but you really have to attack it from both ends. It’s slow. But
eventually it will happen.” ■ Emilie Coulter24 Plymouth Magazine | Fall 2015

contaminated by dried dirt and pond residue. For Nancy Blakney Gravina ’82, it began with a campus tour and
Frisbee on the Mary Lyon lawn.
“In my college search I had been
told, ‘You’ll know it when you
see it.’ That moment in front of
Mary Lyon cemented Plymouth State for me and ultimately
made me who I am today.”
For Tom Gravina ’81, it was in
the lobby of Belknap Hall. “I remember it as if was yesterday. Nancy and I were introduced by
a mutual friend and we’ve been
together ever since.”
What lasts a lifetime? Lessons
learned from teammates. Strong
friendships. Memories of tubing
the Pemi. The feeling that comes from making a difference in the
lives of others.

THIS IS MY FINAL MAGAZINE MESSAGE TO YOU,
and I am happy to say that Plymouth State University’s
future is bright.
PSU’s largest integrated academic building, Active Living, Learning,
and Wellness (ALLWell) North, will open in fall 2015. It will serve
as a living-learning laboratory, increasing opportunities to provide
educational, athletic, wellness, and recreational activities to the campus,
local communities, the region, and the state. Like the Savage Welcome
Center and Hanaway Rink before it, ALLWell North will create
momentum to propel PSU forward.
New academic programs are being developed, such as the Doctor of
Physical Therapy (DPT). This exciting program, when approved, will
help to meet the health care needs of our region. Housed in the newly
remodeled Samuel Read Hall Building, DPT will join the departments
of counselor education and school psychology and of nursing, which
have first-rate instructional laboratories there. The nursing simulation
labs are a recreated hospital wing that will enable students to have
the hands-on, minds-on education for which PSU is known. Also
under way this year is a new Center for Student Success to integrate
international efforts, academic advising, and career counseling. The
list goes on.
PSU is recognized for providing a personalized educational
experience. This year, enrollment management efforts and an
integrated marketing communications campaign have led a record
number of prospective students to apply for admission, attend open
houses, and make early deposits for fall 2015. That, too, is exciting.
All of this energy and forward momentum is because of PSU’s
people—the bright and energetic undergraduate and graduate students,
the vibrant faculty and staff members, the dedicated senior leadership
team, the committed alumni, donors, parents, trustees, regional
partners, and friends—all of whom come together on behalf of PSU and
its mission to educate and serve.
In my inaugural address, I spoke of my first visit to Plymouth State
and of being impressed by the people here, by their shared commitment
to student success and to each other as a community, by their genuine
engagement with the region, the state, and beyond. The reason I came
is the reason I have stayed, and I will always love PSU. Together, we
have been able to, as my mother would have said, “imagine a way” to
do good and transformational work. I look forward to helping with the
presidential transition and cheering as PSU continues to advance into
that bright future.

Staci Keenan is a victim’s advocate with Voices Against Violence, a local crisis
services agency. Kaleb Hart ’11 photo.
Staci Keenan ’14 of
Jaffrey, NH, was 11
years old and home
alone when intruders broke in.
Fortunately she was unharmed,
but the experience changed her
life forever: it inspired her to
help people. “The way that I was
helped by my local police depart-ment—
they were great,” recalls
Keenan, who was honored with a
Brave Citizen of New Hampshire
Award from the state the follow-ing
year. “They made me feel like
I was part of the investigation
process and kept me and my
family informed about how the
investigation was progressing and
when the robbers were caught. I
wanted to help people the way that
they helped me.”
Years later, when Keenan
started her college search, she
knew exactly what she wanted: a
small New England school that
offered a criminal justice major.
Plymouth State was the perfect
fit. “The criminal justice program
was a huge motivation for me to
come here,” she says. “Many of
the professors have worked or
currently work in the field, so I
knew they wouldn’t be teaching
me from textbooks; they’d be
teaching me from first-hand
experience.”
The program and its faculty
weren’t the only things that won
Keenan over. “After walking
around the beautiful campus
and hearing about the different
student clubs and organizations,
I could see myself fitting in and
thriving here,” she says.
As it turns out, Keenan did fit
in and she has certainly thrived at
PSU. “The first week of my fresh-man
year, I went into my advisor’s
office to introduce myself and I
said, ‘This is my plan: I want to
study abroad, graduate early, and
go to law school. Let’s make it
happen,’” she recalls.
Keenan’s advisor, Christopher
Warn ’02, ’03G, who is not only
a PSU faculty member but also
police chief of Campton, NH,
worked with her to ensure she got
the most out of her PSU experi-ence.
Keenan spent a semester
abroad at the Universidad de
Málaga in Málaga, Spain, where
she took her electives and general
education courses, became fluent
in Spanish, and traveled through-out
the country. An internship
at the Cheshire County Regional
Prosecutor’s Office in Keene, NH,
gave her an opportunity to apply
what she’d learned in class to the
real world. She took extra courses
each semester, as well as during
the summer and winter, to earn
her degree a semester early. She
was inducted into the Criminal
Justice Honor Society as a sopho-more,
an honor reserved for
students who have a GPA of 3.2
or higher and rank in the top 35
percent of their class. And she
achieved all of this while holding
down various part-time jobs on
and off campus.
While law school remains a
long-term goal, Keenan is find-ing
great satisfaction in her role
as victim’s advocate with Voices
Against Violence, a local crisis
services agency she joined shortly
after earning her Bachelor of Arts
in Criminal Justice last December.
Her responsibilities include
working with victims of domestic
and sexual violence crimes, put-ting
them in touch with lawyers,
accompanying them to court, and
more. “I’ve been there for four
months and I love it,” she says.
“I’m learning so much.”
Keenan’s education and
her work with Voices Against
Violence have confirmed that
the goal she set for herself as an
11-year-old—to help people as
she was helped—is indeed what
she wants to do with her life. “It’s
truly rewarding to see the differ-ence
you can make in the life of
another person,” she says. “This
experience has shown me that
victim advocacy is what I want
to be doing. This is my passion.”

“It’s truly rewarding to
see the difference you
can make in the life of
another person.”
Professor Norton Bagley, 1920–2014
4 Plymouth Magazine ■ Spring 2015
Norton Bagley’s life reads
like the script for a Hol-lywood
movie: a poor
boy with a genius IQ and a severe
stuttering problem dreams of
going to college and becoming
a teacher. With the help of an
unlikely champion—a respected
college president—he overcomes
faculty skepticism and is admit-ted
to college. After a few years
of teaching and serving in World
War II, he furthers his education
on the GI Bill and returns to
his alma mater as a professor,
becoming a beloved educator,
administrator, and ultimately, a
campus legend.
I reconnected with Profes-sor
Bagley at PSU in May 2006
during my 40th reunion. Shortly
afterward, I wrote a letter to
him, acknowledging him for
touching my life. He wrote a
lengthy letter back and we started
a correspondence that lasted six
out to the whole class because
he liked the way I had clarified
some ideas. Even after graduation
he was supportive, driving three
hours round-trip to Hampton one
night to meet with some of us who
were starting a Seacoast alumni
chapter. His presence always
made a statement.
A Life Unfolds in Letters
In the first letter I received from
Professor Bagley shortly after we
reconnected at reunion, he began
sharing his life story:
“I was bullied often because of
my small size and stuttering. I
created an extensive fantasy
world to retreat to. Using a pile
of bricks behind my house, I
created castles and worlds that
only I dwelled in ... I stuttered
as soon as I could speak due to
the turmoil in my home.”
Despite a difficult home
life, Bagley excelled at school
and skipped second grade. To
overcome his fear of public
speaking due to his stutter, he
would force himself to raise his
hand in class whenever possible
and even entered speech contests.
“I wanted to make something of
myself,” he explained. Interest-ingly,
he was very comfortable
onstage, acting in school plays. “I
did not stutter. I was someone
else,” he wrote.
His knowledge of history was
so great that his 8th-grade social
studies teacher would let him
substitute teach on occasion. “It
was during that experience that
I knew I wanted to be a teacher,”
he recalled. The teacher, Viola
Brown, was asked at her retire-ment
party who her brightest
students were. “Norton Bagley
and Alan Shepard,” she replied.
Professor Bagley said this was his
favorite compliment.
The Happiest Years
In his senior year at Pinkerton
Academy in Derry, Bagley had
an admission interview with the
president of Plymouth Normal
School, Ernest Silver. “He was
interested in helping people
with disabilities enter teaching,”
Bagley recalled in a letter. Presi-dent
Silver was blunt, saying to
the young aspiring teacher, “You
will be my personal guinea pig,”
and overruled the school’s faculty
who expressed reservations.
There was no tuition then
and Bagley received 30 dollars
a month from the National
Youth Administration, an agency
created by Franklin Delano Roos-evelt
as part of the New Deal. The
program helped more than 4.5
million young people find work,
get vocational training, or, like
Bagley, get an education. He also
took a variety of odd jobs to pay
for his room and board since his
family had no money.
In 1937, there were 200
women and only 10 men at
the Normal School. In one of
his letters, Professor Bagley
years. His letters made me feel
like I was having a conversation
with my favorite professor, and I
quickly came to view him as both
friend and colleague. I saved his
letters—35 in all, totaling 150 sin-gle-
spaced pages—sensing they
were both social history as well as
an uncommon autobiography.
The Gifted Professor
“As I speak to you, I may get stuck
on some words, so bear with
me …” This was how Professor
Bagley started his address to my
classmates and me at freshman
orientation in September 1962.
In those first few words, I think
we sensed that if he could deal
with his stuttering problem in
such a public way, we could
surely deal with our insecurities
about college.
I took Professor Bagley’s
child development class on the
third floor of Rounds Hall. His
teaching style projected both a
matchless mastery of content and
a sensitivity to people. When, in
an autobiographical piece, I wrote
that I was floundering with some
of my beliefs, he wrote a comment
in the right-hand margin: “Try
the Unitarian writers like Thoreau
and Emerson.” In my senior year,
I signed up for another class with
him and took a risk by writing a
satire instead of the serious paper
that was expected of me. Anxious
that I might have offended him, I
was surprised to find out that he
had the paper copied and handed
A Life Unfolds in Letters
My correspondence with Professor Norton Bagley ’41  Peter Jarrett ’66
Plymouth State University ■ plymouth.edu/magazine 5
describes late-night bull
sessions discussing philosophy,
world affairs, and a peace
movement that was developing
at the time. He also met
President Silver’s friend and
former Normal School faculty
member Robert Frost—by
then a three-time winner of
the Pulitzer Prize for poetry.
Looking back on his experience
at Plymouth Normal School, he
commented, “My four years at
Plymouth were the happiest of
my life ... I found acceptance.”
A Long and Fulfilling Career
Shortly after graduating in 1941,
Bagley taught 8th-grade social
studies in Pittsburg, NH, averag-ing
45 students in a class. When
the US entered World War II, he
enlisted in March of 1942. In an
eight-page, single-spaced letter
he described his experience as
a clerk typist in a medical corps
and his brief stint in an artillery
unit. He was involved in the
invasion of North Africa and
Italy, and recounted a harrowing
experience when German planes
repeatedly attacked his landing
craft. “It is difficult to dig a fox-hole
on the hull of a steel ship, but
we tried,” he wrote. He earned a
Bronze Star for his service.
Bagley got his PhD through
the GI Bill and began teaching
in the early 1950s at Plymouth
Teachers College. He would
weave back and forth between
administrative and teaching
positions throughout his 32-year
career. Along with being a
professor of education, he served
as chair of the education depart-ment,
dean of instruction, and
dean of students, and worked
closely with President Harold
Hyde throughout his presidency,
which spanned from 1950 to 1977.
“He would tell you he wanted you
in a certain role—he did not ask
you,” Bagley wrote. He watched
President Hyde’s leadership style
change from authoritarian in the
’50s and ’60s to more democratic
in the tumultuous ’70s. “Hyde
wanted to grow the College and
he was successful at it,” Professor
Bagley noted.
I loved his sense of humor. In
one class, a student asked him
how candid he should be in an
autobiography. With a slight
smile, Professor Bagley said,
“Don’t include anything I could
hold against you.” Describing his
decision to retire he said, “I knew
it was time when the students
stopped laughing at my jokes.”
Professor Bagley retired in
1982 and immersed himself in
studying his ancestry. He traveled
to Europe as well as throughout
the US. Additionally, he did
intensive transcription work
at local cemeteries for the NH
Historical Society. He read vocif-erously
and was an avid gardener.
He was also a caregiver for a
friend with Parkinson’s disease.
He moved to the Taylor Commu-nity
in Laconia, NH, in the 1990s
where he died on February 23,
2014, after a long illness. Com-menting
on his particular branch
of the Bagley family, he observed:
“I am the last leaf on the tree.”
In one letter he expressed his
life philosophy; the ideals that
he lived by: “Put me down as
one who always worshipped the
Romantics and the Transcen-dentalists
... and one who still
believes in our youth ... that the
world is not going to the dogs and
that the best is yet to be.”
Peter Jarrett ’66 was active as an
undergraduate student, serving as
student council president. He has
been a lifelong educator, working
as a Head Start director, social
studies teacher at Portsmouth
(NH) High School, director of
guidance at Farmington (NH)
High School, and manager of the
Project Pride Program (for at-risk
students). Jarrett is retired and
living in Boynton Beach, FL, with
his wife, Joyce, an artist.

CLOSING THE GAP
$2.2 million grant propels aspiring school psychologist toward a career
When Emily Russell ’15CAGS
started teaching 16 years ago, she
quickly realized that academics
were taking a backseat to her stu-dents’
social and emotional needs.
The more time she spent in the
classroom, the more she wanted
to help in a way that focused
on their mental and behavioral
health. “I loved being a classroom
teacher,” she says, “but I saw a
need in some children that sur-passed
what I was able to provide.”
According to the US Depart-ment
of Health and Human
Services, an estimated one in five
children has a diagnosable mental
health disorder, and nearly two-thirds
of them do not receive the
help they need. Compounding the
issue, the National Association of
School Psychologists (NASP) proj-ects
a cumulative shortage of close
to 15,000 school psychologists by
2020. Without early diagnosis and
treatment, children with mental
health issues often have problems
at home and in school that can
continue into adulthood.
Determined to be part of the
solution, Russell returned to
graduate school, first earning a
master’s degree in school psych-ology,
then enrolling in PSU’s
Certificate of Advanced Graduate
Studies program in school psych-ology.
As a married mother of
two young children, Russell
immediately felt the pressure
of balancing work, studies, and
family. Given the demands of her
internship—an unpaid 1,200-
hour, yearlong field experience
in a public school setting—the
last year has been especially
challenging. Russell is interning
in four schools with students from
preschool to 12th grade in both
general and special education.
Having a part-time job on top
of her other responsibilities was
nearly impossible.
Until this year, most interns in
the PSU counselor education and
school psychology program faced
similar challenges. But when the
Sandy Hook shootings brought
into the national spotlight the
need for more behavioral health
professionals in schools and com-munities,
President Obama took
swift action. Last fall, Obama,
with the support of the US De-partment
of Health Resources and
Services Administration (HRSA),
launched a grant initiative to
provide funding for students
pursuing degrees in behavioral
health. The grant netted PSU a re-markable
$2.2 million—one of the
largest social sciences grants ever
awarded to a University System of
New Hampshire institution.
For Russell and other interns
in the school psychology, school
counseling, and clinical mental
health counseling programs—39
this year alone—the grant rep-resents
$10,000 that will not be
coming out of their own pockets.
Instead, they can focus on pre-paring
to hit the ground running
as behavioral health profession-als
next year. And there is an
excellent chance they will have
a job when they graduate: PSU’s
school psychology program has
had a 100 percent job placement
rate over the past three years;
school counseling and clinical
mental health counseling boast
similar success.
Without the financial support,
Russell says, “I would likely have
had to take out loans. The stipend
was enough to make a year of
full-time unpaid work feasible for
my family.”
Addressing a Critical Shortage
Professor of Counselor Education
and School Psychology Cindy
Waltman was the primary author
of PSU’s HRSA grant application.
Waltman knew Mary Sherlach,
the school psychologist who was
killed in the Sandy Hook tragedy.
When she heard about the grant
initiative, she knew right away it
was just what PSU—and this coun-try—
needed. “We hope to fill the
schools with well-prepared school
psychologists and school counsel-ors,”
she says. “And we need more
clinical mental health counselors in
our communities.”
Russell says, “This grant
allows people to enter into
these programs who may not
have otherwise, and in that
way it’s increasing the work
force.” PSU, NASP, and the New
Hampshire Association of School
Psychologists are dedicated not
only to growing the numbers
of school psychologists in the
field, but to broadening their
role to better serve all children.
The grant addresses the need for
training at a range of intervention
levels, from children with minor
social skills issues to those who
struggle with substance abuse,
violence, or suicidal tendencies.
In Russell’s internship, she
has witnessed first hand how
the shortage in mental health
services has affected children.
It’s not uncommon for a school
psychologist to be in four or five
different schools during the week,
she says, making it challenging for
them to focus on the primary tier
of prevention: an approach that
decreases risk factors and builds
resilience for all students. Instead,
they end up seeing the students
who are already having more sig-nificant
trouble. When she begins
her career as a school psychologist
next year Russell plans to build a
support network to identify and
help children before they start to
struggle. “This grant and my work
at PSU have helped train me to
build partnerships with agencies,
teachers, school counselors, and
families to help as many kids as
possible and prevent problems
before they begin,” she says.

to manage operations
in ALLWell North’s
first year
No one would question Athletic
Director John Clark ’71, ’73G
if he said he was ready to retire
after serving PSU for more than
four decades.
Instead, this fall, he will
transition from his role as ath-letic
director—a post he held for
more than 20 years—to take on
an exciting new position as
founding manager of ALLWell
North, PSU’s state-of-the-art,
107,600-square-foot academics
and athletics complex slated to
open in October. It’s a project
that Clark has been deeply
involved in and excited for from
the beginning, so it’s only fitting
that he will oversee the building’s
operations in its inaugural year.
“I couldn’t be more excited for
what ALLWell North will mean
to our students, to the com-munity,
and to the state of New
Hampshire,” he says. “It’s another
crown jewel in the evolution of
the campus, just like the Savage
Welcome Center and Hanaway
Rink, the Silver Center for the
Arts, and so many other projects
that have transformed PSU. I’m
grateful for this opportunity.”
And PSU is grateful that its
newest crown jewel will be in
good hands. —Barbra Alan

Samuel Read Hall’s Second Act
The evolution of an innovative educator and a beloved campus building
For more than 90
years, students of
Plymouth Normal School,
Plymouth Teachers College,
Plymouth State College, and
Plymouth State University called
Samuel Read Hall Residence Hall
home. But after a 16-month
renovation, the beloved residence
hall—named for an innovative
teacher educator who taught
at Holmes Plymouth Academy
in the late 1830s—is enjoying
a new life as a center for STEM
programming, housing the depart-ments
of Counselor Education
and School Psychology (CESP)
and Nursing, as well as the Center
for the Environment and Center
for Rural Partnerships.
An Educator’s Educator
For someone who ultimately
became renowned as an innovative
teacher educator and a respected
author on education, Samuel Read
Hall came from humble educa-tional
beginnings. When he was
growing up in the early 1800s,
schools in rural northern New
England were few and far between.
By the time he was 15, Hall barely
had a year’s worth of schooling to
his credit. His real education was
completely self-directed, as he
devoured his father’s small but
excellent collection of books, his
favorite being Locke’s Essay Con-cerning
Human Understanding,
one of the classic works of early-modern
empiricist philosophy.
All that reading paid off for
Hall, who was hired as a teacher
in Rumford, ME, at the age of 19.
He proved to be a visionary edu-cator,
teaching his students not
only grammar and penmanship,
but also how to write composi-tions—
something that parents
initially objected to as being too
hard for young children. Hall
won them over and soon compo-sition
was a weekly exercise, its
value obvious to all.
In 1823, he founded the first
training institute for teachers in
the US, the Columbian School
in Concord, VT, where he taught
all key subjects, lectured in
pedagogy, and operated a model
“This project represents a truly
creative solution to repurposing
and preserving a historical build-ing
and making it genuinely work
for twenty-first-century needs,”
says President Sara Jayne Steen.
“The building gracefully retains
historic features while providing
modern classroom and laboratory
space. It’s now a lively home for
talented faculty dedicated to help-ing
students grow and succeed.”
It’s a transformation that the
building’s namesake would have
certainly approved.
Plymouth State University ■ plymouth.edu/magazine 9
school so his students could
practice teaching. In 1827, his
first book, A Child’s Assistant to a
Knowledge of the Geography and
History of Vermont, introduced
a new approach to geography
instruction by starting with the
child’s own community and
working outward.
His second book, a teacher’s
manual titled Lectures on School-
Keeping, appeared in 1829 and
was a sensation, earning its
author not just a national reputa-tion,
but also job offers from all
over the country. After a stint
at Phillips Academy in Andover,
MA, he accepted a teaching post
at Holmes Plymouth Academy
on the condition that he could
start a co-educational teaching
department. A strong supporter
of female educators—most
formal teaching was done by men
in those days—his 1832 book,
Lectures to Female Teachers, was
surely the first book of its kind,
and inspired more women to
pursue teacher training.
In 1838, Holmes Plymouth
Academy boasted 248 students,
nearly half of whom were women.
During his time in Plymouth,
Hall broadened the educational
scope of Holmes Plymouth
Academy and earned an honorary
master’s degree from Dartmouth
College—a wonderful honor for
a man who had not attended
college himself.
After Holmes Plymouth
Academy closed, Hall would
teach for another six years before
fully focusing on the ministry.
In his final years, he pursued his
passion for geology, assisting
Vermont State Geologist Edward
Hitchcock on geological surveys.
When Plymouth Normal
School was established in 1871 as
the first state-supported normal
school in New Hampshire, it
drew on a proud tradition of
innovation in education forged
by a national leader in the field,
Samuel Read Hall. It’s a tradition
that continues at PSU to this
day.—Rebecca Noel

Marjorie “Marty” Stokes
was a woman ahead of
her time. Born in New
Britain, CT, in 1921, she came of age
during the Great Depression, when
money, jobs, and food were scarce. It
was during this time that she learned
the value of conservation. After high
school, while most of her peers were
settling down and raising children,
Stokes furthered her education at the
Hartford College for Women and
worked as a fashion designer at the
Barbizon New York.
During World War II, Stokes
traded fashion design for aero-nautical
design after earning an
engineering degree at the Pennsylva-nia
State University. Following a stint
designing propellers at Hamilton
Standard Propeller Corporation in
East Hartford, CT, she felt the time
was right to marry her beau William
R. Bolton, a Navy lieutenant and
graduate of Syracuse University
whom she met while at Penn State,
and raise a family.
But settling down didn’t mean
slowing down. The family, which
grew to include four children,
moved around frequently with
every promotion William Bolton
earned. With each move, Stokes
enjoyed her surroundings to the
fullest and instilled in her children
an appreciation for nature and the
Earth. “There was never a time when
she wasn’t gardening, identifying
plants, and taking us on hikes,” says
Shaughn Bolton, the eldest of the
Bolton children. And long before eat-ing
organically was in vogue, Stokes
made sure her family ate homegrown
vegetables and fruits as often as pos-sible.
“She never used pesticides or
anything that was harmful to people
or the environment,” Bolton says.
“She was very conscious of what we
were putting into our bodies.”
In addition to her love for
the environment, Stokes loved
serving in her community, which
included Plymouth in her later
years. “Wherever she lived, she was
always community-focused,” says
Bolton. “She volunteered at four
different hospitals over the years and
was honored by Speare Memorial
Hospital for 8,000 hours of service.”
Inspired by her mother’s example,
Bolton wanted to find a way to give
back to a community she cared for,
PSU. Bolton worked at Plymouth
State for nearly two decades in a
variety of capacities. The role that’s
closest to her heart is administrative
assistant for the Department of Bio-logical
Sciences and the Department
of Environmental Science and Policy,
where she worked from 2008 until
she retired in 2014. There, she says,
“the staff and the faculty work as a
team to create a comfortable, sup-portive
atmosphere in which to grow
Generous Nature
Shaughn Bolton’s late mother, Marjorie “Marty” Stokes, instilled in her an appreciation for the environment
and a commitment to giving back to her community. To honor her mother’s memory, Bolton established
a scholarship to support environmental science and policy students—tomorrow’s environmental leaders.
“There was never a time when she wasn’t
gardening, identifying plants, and taking us
on hikes.”—Shaughn Bolton
Plymouth State University ■ plymouth.edu/magazine 11
professionally and to work. And the
students are just phenomenal!”
One of Bolton’s responsibilities
was to supervise student workers,
sometimes as many as seven at a
time. “They were my kids,” Bolton
says. “They were with me for four
years, then they graduated, and
there was always a new group com-ing
in. I still keep in touch with
many of them.”
In 2010, Bolton decided that
establishing a scholarship for under-graduate
environmental science and
policy students would be a great way
to support PSU. “I needed to give
back to the department that had
given so much to me, and I knew that
there were students who could use
some scholarship support,” she says.
“So I started the fund and I add to it
whenever I can.”
To date, five students have
received the scholarship. Environ-mental
Science and Policy Depart-ment
Chair Mary Ann McGarry says
Bolton’s gift is inspiring. “Shaughn’s
commitment and generosity toward
our students has become a model for
everyone in our department,” she
says. “This scholarship reflects our
true purpose at PSU—to educate and
support students.”
“Receiving the scholarship was
such an honor for me,” says Allison
Savage ’13, now an environmental
educator. “I always worked hard in
school, and this scholarship not only
recognized that but also rewarded
me for it. There’s a huge amount of
financial stress associated with col-lege—
receiving the scholarship was a
reminder of the community of people
I had supporting me and encouraging
me to work toward my goals.”
For Sarah Ray ’15, the scholar-ship
provided her with more than
financial support—it gave her a
boost in her self-esteem when she
needed it most. “Last year, I was
feeling discouraged about the impact
I was having in the world, and I was
concerned about my future,” she says.
“Receiving the scholarship helped me
feel more confident in myself and
my abilities.”
Not a day goes by when Bolton
doesn’t think about her mother, and
she believes that she’d be pleased
with having this scholarship named
for her. “Mom would be thrilled that
she was part of a student’s success,”
she says. “I believe in PSU and its
students, and she did, too.”
—Barbra Alan
You Can Make a Difference
“You don’t have to be wealthy to make a difference;
you just have to care enough to do something,”
Shaughn Bolton says.
When she established the Marjorie “Marty” Stokes
Environmental Science and Policy Scholarship, Bolton
made the important first step toward supporting the
students she had come to know and care about. To date,
the scholarship has eased the financial burden of a college
education for four students who represent tomorrow’s
environmental leaders. Bolton looks forward to the day
when the fund is fully endowed and can support more
students with larger scholarships. “That’s my dream,”
she says.

People First
The Presidency of Sara Jayne Steen
c
IF YOU ASK PEOPLE WHAT THEY CONSIDER
TO BE HIGHLIGHTS OF PRESIDENT SARA
JAYNE STEEN’S NINE-YEAR PRESIDENCY,
they’ll tell you about the beautiful new and renovated
buildings, sustainability efforts, cutting-edge programs,
and community partnerships. But they’ll also make
a point of sharing their thoughts on her relationships
with those on campus and throughout the community:
how she makes everyone feel special and respected, how
her calm demeanor puts others at ease, and how she
genuinely cares about people, especially students.
In her introductory remarks for her first Faculty Day
on August 23, 2006, President Steen said, “PSU’s future
is something we’ll shape together.” What follows are
just some of the many initiatives launched and nurtured
during her presidency, as told by the people who worked
with her to shape them.
GROWING A
UNIVERSITY
When Sara Jayne Steen became
the 14th president of Plymouth
State University on June 30, 2006,
the University was smaller both
physically and programmati-cally.
Since then, the campus has
flourished. With the opening
of Langdon Woods Residential
Complex, one of the first and
largest residence halls in the
country to receive gold-level
certification from the US Green
Building Council, students are
developing valuable life skills as
they learn to live in an environ-mentally
sustainable community.
EcoHouse provides a new model
of living that immerses students
in a living laboratory that allows
them to experiment with sustain-able
design, alternative energy
sources, and a sustainable way
of living. A new welcome center
and ice arena has enhanced
academics, athletics, and
recreation on campus and beyond
and has led to two MASCAC
Championships for the men’s
ice hockey team. The Museum
of the White Mountains—the
first of its kind—celebrates the
art, history, and culture of the
White Mountains region using
multimedia and online tools
and collections. The Enterprise
Center at Plymouth serves as a
resource and an incubator for
small businesses and is enhanc-ing
economic development in the
region. The construction of the
new Active Living, Learning, and
Wellness (ALLWell) North, an
academic and athletic complex,
will enhance recruitment and
enrollment, provide jobs, and
support academics, research, and
outreach activities when it opens
in October.
Longtime PSU Athletic Direc-tor
John Clark ’71, ’73G fondly
recalls when he and President
Steen served on the planning
committee for the ice arena and

welcome center. “When she started at PSU, we’d already
begun plans for a beautiful new ice arena,” he says. “But
she made it more than that—because of her leadership, it
became not only an ice arena, but also a welcome center for
visitors, and an attractive ‘front door’ for PSU. This was
her vision, and she wouldn’t accept anything less. To me,
that facility truly reflects her leadership.”
Once the ice arena and welcome center opened,
Clark—who has lived in Plymouth for more than four
decades—was gratified to see how often community mem-bers
visited campus, particularly to enjoy the ice arena.
“Everyone in Plymouth, in the region, feels so welcome and
comfortable here, and that’s because of President Steen,”
he says. For Clark, one night in particular typifies the
president’s vision. “In 2013, the men’s ice hockey team was
in the MASCAC championship game. At the end of the
night, we had lost the game,” he recalls. “But nobody left
afterward. The stands were filled with PSU students and
community members chanting ‘PSU! PSU! PSU!’ together.
That’s the story I want to tell about President Steen. What
she’s done for this campus and the community—we’ll
never be able to thank her enough.”
Building a Sustainable
Campus
Less than a year into her presidency, President Steen
was a charter signatory of the Presidents’ Climate
Commitment, pledging PSU’s participation in a broad
effort by the nation’s higher education institutions to
address global warming. The signing was a catalyst for
the creation of PSU’s Climate Action Plan and its Office
of Environmental Sustainability (OES), both initiatives
to help move the campus closer to climate neutrality. The
Mary Lyon Residence Hall remodel completed in 2008
joined Langdon Woods in earning awards for design and
sustainable construction. Shortly after, EcoHouse opened
and the Department of Environmental Science and Policy
was created, offering both undergraduate and graduate
degree programs. In 2010, PSU opened the energy-efficient
Hanaway Rink and Savage Welcome Center,
which garnered Business NH Magazine’s Lean and Green
Building Award for cost containment and sustainability.
Professor Brian Eisenhauer, OES director, is at the
center of Plymouth State’s sustainability and climate
neutrality efforts, and has worked with President Steen
to ensure PSU is the greenest it can be. “President Steen’s
commitment to sustainability has established PSU as a
leader,” he says. “Her support of sustainability throughout
our capital planning, and in our daily operations, has been
essential to our success. Because of her support, we have
a Climate Action Plan, several programs that encourage
conservation within the campus community and promote
efficiency, and a growing sustainability presence in our
curriculum. Removing trays from the dining halls to
reduce food waste, installing low-flow fixtures across cam-pus,
and increasing our recycling efforts have been made
possible by her leadership.”
Even more than her support of PSU’s sustainability
initiatives, Eisenhauer appreciates President Steen’s sup-port
of students. “One of my OES student employees got to
know President Steen very well; and I know the time that
President Steen spent with her was sincerely appreciated,”
he says. “Another student who works in OES received a
scholarship. The president helped make that happen by
recognizing her good work. I really appreciate President
Steen’s support for students. Sometimes those efforts were
visible, and other times she’s worked behind the scenes.
In all cases her dedication to students and her advocacy
for their well-being have been essential parts of her
professional life that I greatly admire. She has positively
impacted students’ lives, which should be our highest goal
as educators.”

Meeting the Needs of
the Twenty-first Century
Student
In the last nine years, PSU has added several undergradu-ate
and graduate degree options that prepare students for
rewarding careers in growing industries, such as tourism
management, environmental science, professional sales,
and nursing.
One of the most significant additions to PSU’s offerings,
however, was the Doctor of Education in Learning, Leader-ship
and Community program, launched in summer 2009.
Given PSU’s long history in teacher training and education,
a doctoral program in education was a natural next step,
and had been a goal of many on campus for years. “One
of the first questions President Steen asked when she
started her presidency was, ‘Why don’t we have a doctoral
program?’” recalls Kathleen Norris ’98CAGS, coordinator
of the Doctor of Education program. “From that point on,
she was determined to see that we would.”
Norris was part of the team of PSU faculty, staff, and
administrators who worked to make the program a reality
and says, “President Steen was part of every step in the
process, and the fact that we received unanimous approval
from the state legislature had a lot to do with her.”
President Steen remains highly involved with the
program, promoting its success wherever she speaks,
welcoming each incoming cohort, honoring its graduates,
and attending the annual Doctoral Program Research
Symposium. By doing so, says Norris, “She shows that she
really values students.”
A University of Place
Part of PSU’s mission is to enrich the community and
region in which it resides. The Silver Center for the Arts,
the Hanaway Rink, the Enterprise Center at Plymouth, and
ALLWell North all provide cultural, business, health and
wellness, and recreational resources for the region. And
the work of the Center for the Environment, the Center for
Active Living and Healthy Communities, and the Center
for Rural Partnerships—PSU’s centers of excellence for
healthy places, healthy people, and healthy economies—
benefit the region while providing learning opportunities
for students and research opportunities for faculty.
Experiential education combined with regional
service has become a hallmark of a Plymouth State
education, and has earned PSU a place among only 311
other higher education institutions nationally that have
received the community engagement classification from
the Carnegie Foundation.
“Ours is not a town-gown relationship, it’s a dynamic
partnership between the University, the town, local
businesses, and nonprofits,” says Valerie Scarborough, a
member of the Plymouth select board from 2009 until
2015. Scarborough has been a speaker for several fall
Convocation exercises. “From the day students arrive, the
message is there—the town leadership is a partner with
the University. And when we celebrated Plymouth’s 250th
anniversary in 2013, Sara Jayne was an honored speaker.
That same day, the University held Summerfest in front of
Mary Lyon Hall, and the community was invited to par-ticipate.
There were people who’d been living in Plymouth
their whole lives and hadn’t been on campus who came to
enjoy the food, games, and music. It was wonderful! Sara
Jayne has always invited community members to A Joyful
Noise holiday concert, then to her house for Christmas
cheer. It has gotten so popular that we had to move it to the
HUB because her house wasn’t big enough!”
But it wasn’t just the good times when Plymouth could
count on President Steen, Scarborough points out. “At the
memorial service for the 10th anniversary of 9/11, Sara
Jayne and I both spoke,” she says. “After Hurricane Irene,
we stood together by a flooded road, waiting for the Gov-ernor
to arrive … celebrations and emergencies, she’s been
there for all of them. We stood together, and I hate to see
her go.”
Holderness residents and business owners Dick and
Betty Hanaway have also been impressed with President
Steen’s emphasis on community engagement. “Sara Jayne
has done a wonderful job developing relations between
the University and the community,” says Dick Hanaway.
“She’s been able to captivate the imagination of our town
and translate it into a mutually beneficial partnership
with the University.”
“She’s a genuine,
warm, and friendly
person, and I hope
the next president
will connect with
students as well
as she has.”—Alex

Student Success
The first in her family to attend college, President Steen
has dedicated her professional life to helping other first-generation
college students experience the transformative
power of education. Throughout her presidency she has
ensured that PSU prepares its students for rewarding
careers and lives enriched by service, global citizenship,
and a lifelong love of learning.
Alex Herbst ’15 clearly remembers when he first met
President Steen. “Our class came in right after Hurricane
Irene came through,” the meteorology major says. “The
flooding delayed Convocation and the first day of classes
by a few days, so everything felt a bit off. When we did have
Convocation, President Steen seemed so calm, so in control,
and so welcoming, that it had a calming affect on us.”
In the years since, Herbst has seen President Steen
regularly due to his involvement with student government.
“She comes to the Student Senate meetings, listens to us,
and shares what the administration is discussing,” he says.
Moreover, he says, she is in tune with what students want
and need, and is their staunchest advocate. “When we’ve
asked her about something, there was never a time when
she said, ‘No, that’s not possible.’ Instead she says, ‘We
can do that,’ or ‘I will look into it.’ She holds students in
high regard.”
Whether introducing herself to students and their
families at Move-In Day, hosting students in her home, or
simply having a conversation while walking across campus,
President Steen makes the effort to get to know people on a
personal level.
And according to Herbst, President Steen not only
remembers students’ names, but also personal details. For
example, he says, “A few days after Hurricane Sandy, Presi-dent
Steen made a point of checking in with me to see how
my family was because she remembered that I was from
New Jersey,” Herbst says. “I couldn’t believe it. And now
that I’m ready to graduate, she’s asked me what my plans
are. I never expected to have that kind of relationship with
a college president. She’s a genuine, warm, and friendly
person, and I hope the next president will connect with
students as well as she has.”
Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Julie
Bernier has worked side-by-side with President Steen
for her entire presidency. “Sara Jayne is a quintessential
leader, an effective manager, and one of the most effective
advocates Plymouth State has ever had,” she says. “It is
her values however, that I appreciate most. She puts people
first. It has been a joy to work with someone with whom I
share values and vision for the future.”
President Steen certainly made good on her Faculty Day
promise nine years ago. She and faculty, staff, students,
and community members, have shaped PSU’s future
together.—Barbra Alan

Readers, we want to hear from you!
What are some of your favorite memories of President Steen? Share them in the online
version of this story at plymouth.edu/magazine.
What did you learn about
yourself during your presidency?
I learned how comfortable I
can feel in a job from day one. I
found so much joy in my work.
People would meet with me and
say, “I’d love to have your job.”
And I’d think, “You’re right. It’s a
great job, and I’m glad it shows.”
Also, I learned how much I enjoy
helping people succeed at this
level. It’s what I did as a teacher,
and I’ve drawn on many of those
same attributes.
What surprised you most about
being president of PSU?
How profoundly moving being
president would be. There are
more good things, good stories,
than I could ever share. I had no
idea the degree to which I’d be a
repository of the history, stories,
and connections that are PSU;
the degree to which I became
the University storyteller, on
campus, around the region, and
beyond. That was a surprise—a
wonderful one.
5Questions for
President Steen
What does leadership mean
to you?
Part of how I see leadership is as
a team. I have a role, other people
have their roles, and we need to
work together to make positive
change. I’ve spoken at events
where I talk about the difference
between a hero and a leader: a
hero comes in, does something
wonderful, and then leaves,
whereas a leader is a part of the
community, part of the team that
collaborates to do something
wonderful, and then stays to see
it thrive.
What do you see for PSU in
the next decade?
I expect to be cheering as PSU
goes to new levels. There’s such
a vibrant, energetic team on
campus. ALLWell North will be
making an important impact on
By the
Numbers
During Sara Jayne Steen’s
presidency:
teaching, research, recreation,
and economic development ... it’s
going to be exciting to watch. I’m
excited about PSU’s future.
What are your plans for after
the presidency?
My husband Joe and I built a
getaway on Lake Winona, so we’re
going there first. We also want to
travel this summer, to celebrate our
35th wedding anniversary.
I’ve agreed to write a chapter for a
book coming out next year, and
I’m still a member of the PSU
faculty, so I may be doing some
teaching and research. There are
many opportunities.

Out of Hibernation:
Drerup Bear Figurine
Returns Home
Joann Weeks Bailey ’50 (pictured on right) and
her daughter, Roberta Bailey ’78 (left) returned to
campus in March accompanied by a family trea-sure—
a ceramic bear created in celebrated artist
Karl Drerup’s classroom almost 70 years ago.
Drerup, Plymouth State’s first art professor, started
in 1948, the same year Joann began her studies.
Drerup helped her create the bear in the basement
art studio of Rounds Hall; he would later become
a nationally renowned American enamellist and
New Hampshire Living Treasure.
Joann is the third member of four generations of
her family to attend Plymouth.
Her grandmother, Winnifred Page Smith ’00, and
mother, Esther Smith Weeks ’24, graduated from
Plymouth Normal School; Roberta Bailey ’78, com-pletes
the family’s multi-generational connection.
Joann said donating the ceramic piece to her
alma mater was a joy. “I have such wonderful
memories of my experience here. I felt Plymouth
should have my Drerup bear for its collection
and safekeeping,” she explains. PSU maintains
a collection of Drerup’s artwork, much of it
donated by his former students.—Bruce Lyndes
“Like many others, I was devastated to hear of the
passing of David McBride. To me, he was a great
friend, mentor, and occasional psychiatrist. I cannot
begin to describe the impact he had on my life, as
well as countless others. He is a legend and will be
greatly missed.”—Chris Trapp ’06, ’07G on Instagram

ALUMNI PROFILE
JAMISON CLOUTHIER ’08
amison Clouthier ’08 manages cloud sales and
strategy for the Northeast at Hewlett-Packard (HP).
An award-winning sales representative, Clouthier
works with clients, partners, and HP account teams
to strategize how building a cloud model in their own
environment can help businesses innovate, reduce
costs, and create a competitive advantage.
Plymouth Magazine talked with Clouthier about his
remarkable career trajectory in the short time since
he graduated from PSU.
How did you come to your
career choice?
I never would have thought my
career would be in sales. When I was
little, I wanted to create commercials
and be a professional athlete. In
college I was interested in marketing,
economics, and finance, putting a
pure focus on business.
It wasn’t until my final year at
PSU that I took a professional
sales course and realized I had an
interest in the subject. I ended up
representing PSU at the National
Collegiate Sales Competition in
Georgia and, amazingly, walked
away with nine job offers; I selected
Hewlett–Packard based on industry
reputation, corporate culture,
training, and, most importantly,
opportunities for advancement.
You’ve been recognized as a
high performer (in the top 1
percent) at HP, a company with
more than 300,000 employees,
and have held multiple roles
with increasing levels of
responsibility since starting in
2008. What motivates you?
I love what I do and am 110 percent
motivated by our ability to help cli-ents
exceed their goals. It’s gratifying
when a project you work on comes
to fruition and is market changing
for that client.
Finding the Silver Lining in Cloud Computing

Plymouth State University ■ plymouth.edu/magazine 23
It sounds like you’re “on” all
the time. What’s your favorite
way to unwind?
My favorite place on Earth is the
Lakes Region. There’s nothing like
spending the week on the lake relax-ing,
enjoying the views of the area,
and tubing and wakeboarding.
As part of a generation that
prioritizes flexibility and
autonomy, what benefits have
you experienced from making
a long-term commitment to
one employer?
I’ve been fortunate to work for a
great company like HP and have
built strong relationships both inside
and outside of the company. Over
the last seven years, I’ve experienced
the best of times and times of turbu-lence.
I’ve learned how to navigate
adversity and varying economic
conditions. Every role I’ve held has
challenged me in different ways,
enabling me to continuously learn
and work on advancing my profes-sional
skillset.
Describe your work on PSU’s
Sales Advisory and NH Jobs
for America’s Graduates (JAG)
boards. How have you grown
through your experiences with
each organization?
I look at both of these organizations
as a way for me to give back. With
NH JAG, we aim to prevent high
school students from dropping out
by creating positive change through
education, leadership, training, and
career-building programs. With
the PSU Sales Advisory Board, we
make sure the program is preparing
today’s students for tomorrow’s jobs.
We want to help students build a
solid foundation they can carry into
the real world, regardless of position
or industry.
Serving on both boards has given
me the chance to meet intelligent,
talented students and to work along-side
some influential and successful
professionals. It’s helped me gain a
different perspective on the world,
motivating me even further to help
wherever I can to positively influence
young adults.
Why is networking important
in business, especially in areas
such as sales?
Many of the people in your network
will not just be contacts, but friends,
sometimes for life. Networking
helps you learn the dynamics of
your industry from trusted contacts,
accelerates your professional devel-opment
and advancement, and cre-ates
connections. Whether you have
questions about an industry, are
seeking a new position, or are facing
a challenge or obstacle, relationships
are the catalyst for success.
I have put a lot of focus on build-ing
my network by helping others. I
take the “pay it forward” approach.
Without the power of a network, I
never would have met many of the
good friends I have today.
What is your favorite book
of all time?
It’s a hard read, but I’ve gotten a
lot out of The Intelligent Investor
by Benjamin Graham.

ROOTS RUN DEEP
In the early 1800s, Colonel Samuel Holmes gave $500 and a
parcel of land to found Holmes Plymouth Academy, one of the
first formal teacher-training schools in the state. Today, Plymouth
State University stands as a testament to Holmes’ vision.
In 2014, a descendant of Holmes made a generous bequest that
honors her family’s centuries-long commitment to education and
to Plymouth State.
Ann G. Haggart grew up with constant reminders of her family
connection to Holmes. Her mother and her aunts graduated
from Plymouth Normal School; her cousin, from Plymouth
State College. All went on to teach in New Hampshire’s public
schools. “Education is at the center of my family’s history,”
Haggart says. “As my mother said, ‘You educate a woman,
you educate a family.’” Haggart has carried on this tradition
throughout her career as a NH public school teacher who
supported children with special needs, as a national and
international speaker on inclusion, and as a co-author of
books and videos for educators.

Alice Haggart ’28 Mary Haggart ’26
The Holmes-Pattee-Haggart Family Fund provides
scholarship assistance to New Hampshire students who
aspire to teach and promotes transformational leadership
initiatives. Haggart sees the gift as an investment in future
generations of educators and hopes to inspire others to
support scholarships and education. “You don’t have to
have a lot of money,” she says. “You just have to decide
how you want to spend it.”

Welcome to the Spring/Summer issue of Plymouth Magazine,
an issue that provides an introduction to today’s Plymouth State in demonstrating
our place in the world and the degree to which the world becomes smaller through
PSU’s work. Through the features on technology, wind energy, and an artful
donor, for example, you can see how PSU is globally connected, how lines from
all over the map are drawn to Plymouth.
Faculty members at PSU are deeply involved with technology that serves student
learning and extends the academic program worldwide. Even a decade ago, PSU
was creating graduate coursework online, and this year the online MBA was
rated by geteducated.com as among the top 20 programs in the nation. Four
undergraduate programs are offered fully online. PSU faculty members guide
student learning from Romania and Shanghai to Chile and Antigua. In addition
to extending access to a PSU education, technology allows residential students to
work while taking classes, to graduate more quickly, and to collaborate with col-leagues
around the world, maintaining the wider PSU cross-cultural community.
International students also join us on the physical campus, both in Plymouth and
in Concord, where faculty members provide vibrant and collaborative hands-on
learning. The value-added residential experience includes athletics, clubs, intern-ships,
and opportunities for service and engagement that mean that students are
especially well prepared to begin productive careers.
As shown here, PSU is playing a role in the conversation about wind turbines, a
worldwide debate, as well as sustainability, another global conversation. The expe-rience
of two young men separated by a world war and their committed friendship
across countries and decades led to a recent gift of drawings by Spanish painter
Francisco de Goya Lucientes and a collaboration that both inspires students and
celebrates two gifted professors.
Commencement this year was equally international. Students were worldwide,
families unable to travel viewed the exercises via livestream, and the charge to
the graduates was given by the recipient of an honorary doctorate, Richard H.
Solomon, the former president of the US Institute of Peace and one of the major
figures in international conflict management over the past several decades, par-ticipating
in peace agreements across the globe.
I close with a more local moment, but one that crosses time. This year is the 250th
anniversary of the town of Plymouth. It is being celebrated through the year with
wonderful events planned for the weekend of 20–21 July, to which you are invited.
The year began with a beautiful community production of an original musical,
Marking the Moment, written by PSU faculty member Trish Lindberg and profes-sor
emeritus Manuel Marquez-Sterling, with music by New Hampshire composer
Will Ogmundsen. The play treats Plymouth from its founding, through the Civil
War and the Underground Railroad, to Babe Ruth and the present time. This, too,
marks Plymouth State as a university of place, at home and across the globe.

NEW STATE QUARTER
UNVEILED
The beauty of New Hampshire’s
White Mountains was the back-drop
for the unveiling of the new
state quarter at a February 21
event in PSU’s Silver Center,
sponsored by the US Mint and
the US Forest Service.
More than 300 local elemen-tary
school children attended the
event, as well as US Mint acting
director Richard A. Peterson,
Governor Maggie Hassan,
Congresswoman Annie Kuster,
and US Forest Service Supervisor
Tom Wagner. “This coin is a
national recognition of the trea-sure
that we have in the White
Mountains,” President Steen said
at the unveiling. “It celebrates
the beauty and grandeur of New
Hampshire; it says something
significant to the nation.”
PROTECTING AND
PRESERVING SQUAM
LAKES WATERSHED
Plymouth State University’s
Center for the Environment
(CFE) and the Squam Lakes
Association (SLA) have agreed
to continue a joint agreement to
protect and improve the health
of the Squam Lakes Watershed
ecosystem through research,
monitoring, education, and
stewardship of the Squam Lakes
Watershed.
CFE and SLA have previously
partnered on several research
projects such as water quality,
methods for reducing milfoil, a
recreation study, and an analysis
of land use regulations in the
watershed towns. In addition,
the SLA has hired PSU students
for summer field positions and
often supports class field trips,
providing invaluable hands-on
opportunities for PSU students.
Currently, PSU professor
Shannon Rogers is working on a
study of the ecosystem services
provided by the Squam Lakes
watershed.

DISPLAY
AT PSU’S MUSEUM
OF THE WHITE
MOUNTAINS
With so many treasures housed
in PSU’s Museum of the White
Mountains, which opened to the
public in February, it can be hard
for visitors to pick a favorite. But
as museum director Catherine
Amidon notes, there is one piece
that’s particularly popular with
visitors of all ages: a replica of a
Concord coach, the Nancy Flyer
(below). Measuring 34” high, 48”
long, and 28” wide, the diminutive,
painstakingly detailed coach is
perfectly situated in the center of
the museum, and is frequently the
center of attention.
To see the Nancy Flyer and a host
of other White Mountains treasures
in person, visit the Museum of
the White Mountains on campus
at 34 Highland Street. For more

PSU NAMED TO
PRESIDENT’S
HIGHER EDUCATION
COMMUNITY SERVICE
2013 HONOR ROLL
PSU has been named to the
President’s Higher Education
Community Service Honor Roll,
through the federal Learn and
Serve America program, which
supports and encourages service
learning throughout the US. The
honor roll, launched in 2006,
annually highlights the role
colleges and universities play in
solving community problems
and placing more students on a
lifelong path of civic engagement
by recognizing institutions that
achieve meaningful, measureable
outcomes in the communities
they serve.
Plymouth State President
Sara Jayne Steen noted PSU has
been named to the list for all
seven years of the program. “Our
students live the Plymouth State
motto, Ut Prosim (That I May
Serve),” she said. “They both give
and receive enormous benefit
from this good work.”
PSU PUBLICATIONS
Talking about the Weather
Liz Ahl, professor of English
Award-winning poet Liz Ahl
has released a hand-sewn
limited-edition chapbook that
she calls a “love letter to this
part of New Hampshire.” When
Ahl talks about the weather
(“from mud season to the icy
depths of January”) readers
familiar with her work won’t
be surprised to discern another
conversation going on at the
same time, addressing neighbors
and friends, well-loved art, and
the unwelcome jolt of the morn-ing
newspaper. Ahl is tender
in “Neighborly,” writing about
shoveling a path to the mailbox
of a recently deceased neighbor.
And she writes with humor about
the subtle competition among
seekers of the season’s first farm-stand
corn, or a toddler who
licks the chrome bumper of a car
before her father can intervene.
Margaret from Maine
Joseph Monninger, professor
of English
Torn by her commitment to
a husband who was critically
injured in the Afghan war and a
growing love for another veteran,
Margaret must face an age-old
lovers’ dilemma against the back-drop
of patriotic duty.
When asked about his
inspiration for his latest novel,
Joe Monninger says, “One day I
drove past a dairy farm and saw
a woman leading a cow. I tried
to imagine her life and one bit of
imagination led to the next. The
result is Margaret from Maine,
the story of a woman who lived
on a dairy farm and the things
that happened to her.”
Any Other Branch
Ivy Page ’07, faculty in English
In her debut collection, Ivy Page
creates four sections of poems—
Men, Room, Girl, and High
Tide—to represent developmental
life stages. Nine years in the
making, the collection originated
in Professor Liz Ahl’s creative
writing class during Page’s under-graduate
studies. Her poetry is
wry, poignant, and sensual. Lines
in “Word Diet” give readers a
“taste” of her experience writ-ing
the book: “Nothing lately,
from my kitchen/tastes as sweet
as ink—/foregoing dinner for
dessert/a collection of letters/on
the tongue like Honey—/tiny core
of syrup/hidden in—Suckle.”
Reflections from the Forest House
Nancy Puglisi ’81G, professor
of counselor education and
school psychology
Calling her most recent col-lection
“a slice of life,” Nancy
Puglisi’s reflections on friend-ship,
love, and loss are universal.
Spring/Summer 2013 | Plymouth Magazine 5
Tender verses about her affection
for siblings or her fondness for
puttering in the garden coex-ist
with poems reflecting her
passionate opinions about the
environment (“Fundamentals,”
“Superiority”) or gay issues (“In
Defense of What,” “Don’t Ask
Don’t Tell”). Readers of this
highly personal collection may
find themselves feeling an unex-pected
kinship with Puglisi.
An Overture to Philosophy of
Communication
Annette Holba, professor of
rhetoric (with co-author
Ronald Arnett)
Philosophy of communication is
a rapidly emerging field, yet until
Annette Holba and co-author
Ronald Arnett wrote An Overture
to Philosophy of Communication,
there was no real model for
teaching it in the classroom. The
authors set about remedying the
situation with a scholarly book
that is intended for use in the
classroom. The story of Zorba the
Greek is woven throughout the
narrative, exemplifying, as Holba
says, “the ways human beings
make meaning through engage-ment
with others.” The book
won the prestigious Everett Lee
Hunt Award from the Eastern
Communication Association.
Cloud vs. Cloud
Ethan Paquin ’98, faculty in
English
From the book jacket: Ethan
Paquin writes “Language is
notorious.” In his latest collec-tion,
language is as lush and
textured as the mountains and
oceans that are his subjects, and
familiar natural landmarks are
representational of memory so
that mind and body become
layers in this vast loam …. Only
through knowledge of the rough
earth will he come to know the
self: “carry me like a reed-basket
of water over the pinions of land-scapes
/ blasted by heat and then i
will know where i belong.”
Gypsies of the White Mountains
Bruce Heald, faculty in history
and philosophy
After exploring Mt. Washington’s
cog railway, the Old Man of the
Mountain, and the history of
dog sledding in New England,
historian and author Bruce
Heald once again digs deep
into the intriguing past of New
Hampshire’s North Country.
This time he investigates a
little-known group of travelers
through the White Mountains
in the heyday of this region’s
tourism boom: Gypsies. Heald
provides a fascinating history
of this oft-persecuted minority,
and traces their journey to and
through the White Mountains
where, for a time, they made a
living entertaining tourists, tell-ing
fortunes, and making music.
No Vacancy: The Rise, Demise,
and Reprise of America’s Motels
Mark Okrant, professor of
tourism management
No Vacancy is Mark Okrant’s
latest non-fictional look at the
motel industry (previously he
brought us Sleeping Alongside
the Road and a murder mystery
series set in historic resorts).
Okrant, a nationally recognized
expert in tourism research and
director of PSU’s Institute for
New Hampshire Studies, has
been a motel patron all his life.
“Motels were a central part of
incredible experiences with my
parents and brother and, later,
with my wife and daughters,”
he says. “Something needs to be
done to show others why they
were important, and how many
of them can be again.” With this
perspective on the history of
motels and the prospects for sav-ing
them, Okrant has taken a big
step toward that goal.
Writing the Nomadic Experience
in Contemporary Francophone
Literature
Katharine N. Harrington,
professor of French
Literary “nomads,” according to
author Katharine Harrington,
“reconsider rigid definitions
of borders, classifications, and
identities.” In her latest book,
Harrington studies four contem-porary
French-language writers
who are not easily defined by
geographical, cultural, or lin-guistic
boundaries. She writes, “I
examine how these authors’ life
experiences are reflected in their
writing and how they may inform
us on the state of our increasingly
global world where borders and
identities are blurred.”
Prison Violence: Causes,
Consequences and Solutions
Kristine Levan, professor of
criminal justice
In the very first pages of Prison
Violence Kristine Levan boldly
confronts her topic: “violence
[in prison] is not only accepted,
but has indeed become expected
among prisoners and correc-tional
staff …. [S]uccessfully
reducing prison violence means
disentangling the convict code
and disrupting the prison culture
at its very core.” She goes on
to provide a comprehensive
analysis of prison violence and
its impacts, both in and out of
prison. Levan explores the chal-lenges
faced by policy makers
and scholars in understanding
the problem, describes what is
currently being done to address
the issue, and offers myriad
approaches to handle the many
facets of prison violence.

ETC’s Latest Musical Celebrates
Plymouth’s 250th
Plymouth is a town with an intriguing history. In the 1850s and
60s, the Underground Railroad had a stop in Plymouth at the home
of Nathaniel Rogers, which is now the site of the Silver Center. In
1864, former president Franklin Pierce sat at his friend Nathaniel
Hawthorne’s bedside as the great writer lay dying in Plymouth. And
in 1916, baseball legend Babe Ruth—then a pitcher for the Red Sox—
visited the Draper and Maynard Building on Main Street, back when
it was a sporting goods factory.
These moments and others in Plymouth’s history were brought to life
in this year’s Educational Theatre Collaborative (ETC) production,
Marking the Moment. The musical, written by Professor of Education
and ETC Artistic Director Trish Lindberg in collaboration with
Professor Emeritus of History Manuel Marquez-Sterling, was
the first in a number of community events to honor Plymouth’s
sesquicentennial.—Elizabeth Cheney ’89, ’99G

BERGAMO, ITALY, IS A
TOWN STEEPED IN HIS-TORY
AND TRADITION.
Tucked in the foothills of the
Alps, Bergamo is known for its
impressive art collections, diverse
architecture, and hearty cuisine.
Nobel prize-winning novelist
Hermann Hesse once called
Bergamo “the most beautiful
corner of Italy.”
Sara Manzoni ’15 was born
and raised in Bergamo—and she
couldn’t wait to leave it.
“I’ve always wanted to come to
the US—it’s been a lifelong goal,”
says Manzoni, who grew up on
American movies, TV, and music
and came to idealize America
as a land of opportunity and
individuality.
When it came to select-ing
a college, however, it was
much more than the lure of the
independent American spirit
and the appeal of its pop culture
that drew Manzoni to the US;
it was her desire for a quality
education, something she felt
she wasn’t getting in Italy. The
schools she attended educated
students strictly by the book—the
textbook. “Italian schools don’t
focus on the practical application
of what you’re learning,” she says.
Especially disheartening to her
was the apparent apathy of the
administrators and teachers she
encountered. “There’s a lack of
organization, opportunity, and
SARA

AT HOME AT
PLYMOUTH
STATE
support for students in Italian
education,” she says.
Manzoni’s criteria for an
American university were simple:
it had to be on the East coast (so
airfare to and from Italy would
be less expensive), it had to be
affordable, and it had be in New
England, which she knew had
“a reputation for having good
schools.”
PSU was a perfect match, so
Manzoni applied and was admit-ted
for the fall 2011 semester. Her
first visit to campus—indeed,
to the US—was during orienta-tion
week, which gave her the
opportunity to meet other
first-year students, American
and international, and get com-fortable
in her new surroundings
before classes started. It didn’t
take long for her to feel at home
at PSU and to realize she made
the right decision to attend col-lege
here. “Everyone was really
supportive, and everything was
well-organized,” she recalls. “I
would have had a much harder
time adjusting to college in Italy.”
Now finishing up her sopho-more
year, Manzoni is embracing
American life and all that PSU
offers. She’s involved in academic
and social clubs, has friends from
around the world, and enjoys
working part-time at PSU’s
Center for Global Engagement
and serving as a global student
coordinator, which entails
welcoming international stu-dents
into the PSU community,
mentoring them for their first
year, and raising awareness about
other cultures on campus and
in the community. According to
International Student Advisor
Jane Barry, who supervises
Manzoni’s work at the Center for
Global Engagement, Manzoni “is
an exemplary example of a PSU
student leader: caring, dedicated
to her studies, and passionate
about helping other students have
a positive experience here.”
Currently a business major,
Manzoni is considering majoring
in marketing and is grateful for
the support she gets from her
professors as she discovers her
strengths and interests. “The
faculty are ready to help, and they
love what they do,” she says.
Manzoni’s professors praise
her for her maturity and enthu-siasm,
which are serving her
well in her studies. “Sara has a
strong desire to succeed,” says
Robert Nadeau, a faculty mem-ber
in the College of Business
Administration who has taught
Manzoni in Career Exploration
and will teach her this the fall
in Professional Sales Skills II.
“She genuinely appreciates the
opportunity to study at PSU and
is making the most of her experi-ence
here.”
While her studies, work, and
social life keep her busy, the
ambitious Manzoni is always
looking for a new challenge.
These days that includes learn-ing
Russian (having already
mastered English, Spanish, and
French back in Italy) and taking
up the guitar. “I love being busy
and challenged and always learn-ing,”
she says.—Barbra Alan
“I love being
busy and
challenged
and always
learning.”

THE ARTFUL DONOR
A gift from anthropologist and art collector Hans Guggenheim combines art
and education with a powerful tribute to a lifelong friend. by Barbra Alan
incent Van Gogh’s “The Starry Night” is one of the most
famous and well-beloved paintings in the world. Many
people admire the painting without ever having seen it in
person, and appreciate it without knowing the context of its
creation. But just think how that admiration and appreciation
could be enhanced by experiencing the painting, with its violent,
thick brush strokes, in person at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York City. Or by knowing that Van Gogh painted the iconic
landscape from his room in an asylum in southern France, where
he committed himself following a breakdown. Or by being aware
of the prevailing theory among critics, scholars, and art historians
that the painting was heavily influenced by Walt Whitman’s
poetry, particularly “Song of Myself.”
Experiencing a work of art first-hand and understanding the
cultural and historical context in which it was created can increase
one’s appreciation of art, and this is the thinking behind a multi-faceted
gift to PSU from world-renowned anthropologist, artist,
and humanitarian Hans Guggenheim. The gift is allowing PSU
students to experience works of art from Guggenheim’s private
collection on campus, learn more about the artwork by attending
lectures by Guggenheim, and delve into the context of the artwork
in class.
The catalyst for this gift was Guggenheim’s initial gift of four
prints, which he gave to PSU last summer in loving memory of his
lifelong friend, the late Thomas Schlesinger, professor emeritus of
political science. The prints are of etchings by the nineteenth-cen-tury
Spanish painter Francisco de Goya Lucientes, from Disasters
of War, a series in which the artist unflinchingly depicts the hor-rors
and consequences of war he witnessed during the Napoleonic
invasion of Spain.
Artwork that features such grave and unsettling subject matter
may seem an unusual way to honor a friend, but Patricia Powers
Schlesinger says Guggenheim’s gift is a fitting tribute to her late
husband. “The Goyas are a protest of war,” she says. “Tom would
be thrilled [with this gift] because it is absolutely in accordance
with his beliefs and his efforts to promote peace, understanding,
and communication to resolve conflict.”
Both Guggenheim and Schlesinger experienced their own disas-ters
of war as boys and young men in the 1930s and 40s, disasters
that would shape the course of their lives.

HISTORY
In 1935, 9-year-old Hans
Guggenheim met 8-year-old Tom
Schlesinger at the Zickel Schule,
a school in Berlin for Jewish
children. “He was a very lively
kid and we became best friends
almost immediately,” recalls
Guggenheim. The boys bonded
over their shared love of sketch-ing
and playing chess. “We lived
only a block from each other,”
Guggenheim continues, “and
after school, we would play chess
together on top of my bookshelf
in my parents’ apartment on
Berliner Strasse.”
It was an ominous time in
Germany. The Third Reich, with
Hitler as absolute dictator, was
beginning its reign of persecu-tion
against numerous groups,
including liberals, socialists,
communists, homosexuals,
and especially Jews. They were
expelled from civil service
and universities, Jewish busi-nesses
were boycotted, and the
Nürnberg Laws were enacted,
stripping Jews of their German
citizenship and making marriage
and sexual relations between
Jews and German citizens illegal.
Little did young Guggenheim
and Schlesinger know then that
their days of sketching, playing,
and attending the Zickel Schule
were coming to an end.
The Schlesingers were the
first to leave Germany, in 1936.
“Tom’s mother had been very
politically active as a young
woman during World War I,”
says Pat Schlesinger. “When
Hitler came into power, she knew
they had to get out.”
While the Schlesingers
struggled over the next few years
to find refuge from the Nazis,
first by fleeing to Italy, then to
Switzerland, and finally to the
US in 1940, the Guggenheims
remained in Berlin, enduring
an increasingly hostile climate,
until a fateful night in November
1938 made them realize they
would be risking their lives if
they continued to live there.
Kristallnacht, or the Night of
Broken Glass, was a horrific
night of violence and destruction
during which the Nazis and their
supporters vandalized and looted
synagogues, Jewish homes, and
Jewish businesses. “After
Kristallnacht,” Guggenheim
says, “my parents sent me and
my sister to England, where we
attended a Quaker school near
Cambridge.”
The peace and safety
that Guggenheim found in
Cambridge were only temporary.
At the outbreak of World War II,
the British government, concern-ed
about enemy spies infiltrating
the country, rounded up hundreds
of Germans and sent them to
internment camps. Sixteen-year-old
Guggenheim was among
those arrested in London and
taken to an internment camp on
the Isle of Man, located between
Great Britain and Ireland. In
1940 he was released and taken
to Guatemala, where he would
be reunited with his family and
discover his love for Mayan art
and his own talent for painting.
REUNION
When World War II ended in
1945, Guggenheim, anxious to
learn where his childhood friend
Tom Schlesinger was, put an
ad in the Aufbau, a journal for
German Jews around the world.
“I knew Tommy’s parents read it,
and he responded immediately,”
recalls Guggenheim.
The two friends reunited in
New York in 1946, a decade after
war had separated them. By then,
Schlesinger had been in the US
Army for three years, during
which he trained at the Military
Intelligence Training Center
at Camp Ritchie, Maryland,
and became one of the famed
“Ritchie Boys”—an elite group
of young men, mostly German
Jews, who were trained in coun-terintelligence,
interrogation, and
psychological warfare. He helped
break German resistance at the
Battle of the Bulge and Remagen
Bridge—two key battles that led
to Germany’s defeat and the end
of war.
Both men stayed in touch with
each other for the rest of their
lives. “I think they needed each
other,” says Patricia Schlesinger.
“They went through a very trau-matic
time. They may not have
realized it then, but experiencing
what they did gave them an
impetus to make things better.”
In their own unique ways,
Guggenheim and Schlesinger did
make things better in the world.
Guggenheim studied art history
in New York and traveled the
world for Life magazine as an art-ist
and reporter. He spent many
years in Mali, where he helped
build small dams and grain stor-age
systems to help the Dogon
people endure a severe drought
and learned much about Dogon
religious traditions, mask dances,
wooden sculpture, and archi-tecture.
He has been a professor
of anthropology at MIT, and
a visiting scholar at Harvard’s
Center for International Affairs.
A staunch advocate for arts
and education, he founded
Projectguggenheim in 1997,
which provides art programming
for young people and students in
remote regions around the world.
Schlesinger had a distin-guished
21-year career in the US
Army, which included service in
the Korean War, participation in
the trenches during the atomic
tests in Nevada, stints as inter-preter
to two generals, and ser-vice
as a Green Beret instructor.
During this time, he also earned
his baccalaureate, master’s, and
doctoral degrees, which allowed
him to begin a second career as
college professor when he retired
from the army at the age of 42.
He joined the Plymouth State
faculty in 1970, and quickly
proved himself a gifted and com-mitted
educator, dedicated to
transforming his young students
into citizens of the world.
DOING MORE
Dean Cynthia Vascak of PSU’s
College of Arts and Sciences notes
that, shortly after giving PSU the
Goyas last summer, Guggenheim
began considering ways to make
the gift more meaningful. “In
typical Hans fashion, he was look-ing
to do even more,” she says.
And so, last December,
Guggenheim gave a lecture on
the Goyas at PSU, in tandem with
the Disasters of War exhibition
in the Karl Drerup Gallery. “He
was marvelous,” recalls Professor
of Art History Dick Hunnewell,
who attended the lecture with his
Left: Following his presentation on Dogon art,
Guggenheim was joined by Professor of Anthropology
Kate Donahue (left), Professor of Geography Patrick
May, and Professor of Art Terry Downs for a lively
panel discussion. Jeremy Gasowski ’01 photo.

Art and Ideas in the Nineteenth
Century class. “He has such
wonderful insight, and as a
trained anthropologist, he has an
extraordinary sense of civiliza-tion
and humanity. The students
responded to his intelligence and
sense of humor.”
Inspired by the interest and
enthusiasm of students and
faculty during the Goya exhibi-tion
and lecture, Guggenheim
proposed future exhibitions of art,
which would be loaned from his
personal collection, and lectures
to be offered over the next three
semesters, up to and includ-ing
spring 2014. “As we began
planning these exhibitions and
talks, we thought about how to
make this interdisciplinary,” says
Vascak, who contacted Hunnewell
and Professor of Anthropology
Kate Donahue for their input.
Donahue and Hunnewell
met with Guggenheim last fall.
Hunnewell says, “Kate and I
suggested that Hans outline the
works he’d like to exhibit and the
lectures he’d like to give.”
As it happened, Guggenheim’s
vision for future exhibitions
and lectures, featuring the
artwork of the Dogon in Mali;
traditional paintings and bronzes
from China; and artwork from
Guatemala complemented courses
that Hunnewell and Donahue reg-ularly
teach, such as Hunnewell’s
Art and Ideas of the Nineteenth
Century and Art of the Far East
courses, and Donahue’s Religion,
Ritual, and Myth course.
“This is a wonderful oppor-tunity
for the students,” says
Donahue, “to be exposed to
Hans, an anthropologist who
has lived and worked all over the
world, to interact with art from
his collection, and to learn more
about the cultures that influ-enced
those artworks in class. I’m
grateful and delighted that this
has come about.”
For Guggenheim, this
multifaceted gift to PSU is an
expression of who he is and his
belief that the power of art tran-scends
the visual. Experiencing
art and art education helps
promote understanding and
appreciation among people and
cultures, which Guggenheim
says “is essential to our education
for living in a complex world.
The language of art synthesizes
cultural wisdom and the human
experience that is not accessible
in any other form.”

FACULTY FORUM
In his roles as professor, scholar, researcher, mentor, and campus leader, Brian Eisenhauer is at the center
of Plymouth State’s sustainability and climate neutrality efforts. Under his leadership, Plymouth State has
been consistently recognized as a leader in environmental sustainability and is regularly included in The
Princeton Review’s Guide to Green Colleges, a compilation of the most environmentally responsible
higher education institutions in the United States and Canada.
In recognition of his work in inspiring students to care for their world,
Eisenhauer was recently named the first recipient of the Helen Abbott ’39
Professorship in Environmental Studies. The Abbott Professorship supports
the University’s commitment to environmental sustainability and education,
and will enable Eisenhauer to further develop his “green” efforts, grassroots
activism, environmental communications, and program evaluation.
Plymouth Magazine asked Eisenhauer the question:

Combatting Apathy
My work on sustainability and
achieving carbon neutrality
on campus addresses a critical
issue for the world today: global
warming and its impacts. My
most important goal is to help
people make conscious, informed
decisions. As an educator I’m
working to challenge the widely
accepted cultural norms and
asking people to think before
they act.
This is closely connected to
my major concern about the
environment today, people’s
apathy. Environmental change is
generally something that occurs
over time, and it’s a challenge to
focus people’s attentions on these
issues given our culture of elec-tronic
entertainment and com-munication.
The more we can do
to encourage outdoor recreation
and other ways of fostering
people’s understanding of their
relationship to, and dependence
on, the environment, the closer
we will be to addressing the
apathy that prevents most people
from taking even simple steps to
improve that relationship.
Sustainability Starts at Home
For me the most important rule
of sustainable living is to live
simply: by reducing our con-sumption
levels and our use of
natural resources, we lessen our
environmental impact. We also
have less complexity and debt,
and more happiness in our lives.
I’m a big believer in the joys of
simplicity. I’m always looking for
ways to reduce my environmental
impact and to be more involved
with my community. Some sim-ple
ideas I follow are avoiding the
use of disposable goods (use cloth
instead of paper napkins, etc.),
lowering my energy consumption
through conservation in behavior
and through maintaining and
renovating my home, volunteer-ing
in the community, walking
and carpooling when I can, and
overall, making conscious, not
automatic choices.
If we all make even small con-tributions,
change will happen.
Moving Toward a Carbon-
Neutral Campus
In my role at Plymouth State, I
spend a lot of time working on
campus sustainability issues.
The number of efforts at PSU
with sustainability dimensions
is testimony to the importance
Plymouth State places on the
issue. One of our goals to this end
is to be carbon neutral in campus
operations by 2050. To achieve
this, we’re evaluating new fuel
sources—including renewable
energy sources—to convert the
campus infrastructure. We’re
always working with students,
faculty, and staff to improve our
campus community’s relation-ship
with the environment. This
year, we created a new edition of
our campus sustainability guide,
a handbook for being more
sustainable while working and
living on campus (plymouth.edu/
sustainability/green-guide). We
also developed two sustainability
audits: a residential audit so stu-dents
can evaluate their practices
at home and get support for mak-ing
improvements; and the PSU
Green Offices Program, an audit
of office practices.

What is the value of a scenic view?
This year, the Groton Wind Farm
came online with a row of 24 Gamesa
G87 wind turbines planted atop a
ridge in the town of Groton. Iberdrola
Renewables, the Spanish company
that built the wind farm, estimates
that together the turbines will produce
about 48 megawatts of electricity,
enough to power 20,000 average New
Hampshire homes. The turbines, each
256 feet tall with three 139-foot-long
blades, are visible for miles around.
For some people in this region, these
huge turbines are a huge problem.
Proponents of renewable energy
point out that wind is one of the
United States’ many viable ways to
reduce our dependence on foreign oil
and produce electricity without the
carbon emissions that lead to global
climate change. The ability to produce
wind power could be a valuable asset
to the state. Opponents are concerned
about another of New Hampshire’s
valuable assets: its natural beauty.
Do wind turbines detract from New
Hampshire’s natural beauty? Or are
the turbines themselves beautiful?
Will the presence of turbines have a
negative effect on tourism? Or is the
presence of turbines, whether beautiful
or ugly, a reasonable price to pay to
move away from foreign oil and reduce
global warming?
The answers to these questions
are different for different individuals,
based on each person’s values. This
raises other questions: Should these
values-based opinions affect policy
decisions—decisions like granting
or denying permits for wind farms
or providing education to the com-munity
about renewable energy? How
do we know what all those different
values-based opinions are and how
widespread each different opinion
might be?
These are the kinds of questions
that Professor Shannon Rogers, an
ecological economist who joined
PSU’s Center for the Environment in
fall 2012, will address through her
Viewshed Valuation Pilot Study, with
the help of two environmental science
and policy students and a grant from
the National Science Foundation’s
Experimental Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR). The
EPSCoR grant is part of a larger effort
THE VALUE OF A VIEW
A Center for the Environment pilot study investigates local residents’ attitudes
on the value of scenic views. by Marcia Santore
Spring/Summer 2013 | Plymouth Magazine 15
within the Center for the Environment
to build private funding for student
research. “I think conducting
research is integral to the
educational process of our
students,” Rogers says.
The term “viewshed” is used in fields
as diverse as urban planning, archeol-ogy,
and even military science. It refers
to an area of land, water, or some other
part of the natural environment that
can be seen from public areas, such
as a road or a park. The term usually
indicates a place of scenic or historic
value that is worthy of being preserved
in its natural condition. The Groton
Wind Farm, for instance, is placed on
a ridge of hills that can be clearly seen
from several locations in the area. The
wind turbines are distinctly silhouetted
against the sky—for good or ill, they
definitely change the view.
In her research, Rogers uses a
method called multicriteria decision
making, which takes values into
account as part of systematically
looking at a decision-making process.
The Viewshed Valuation Pilot Study
will use this methodology to talk with
stakeholders about the Groton Wind
Farm as it relates to their attitudes and
beliefs about such topics as energy, pri-vate
property, natural beauty, property
values, tourism, and the environment.
“I think we at the Center for the
Environment are in a unique position,
both because of our geography and
our expertise, to help understand these
viewshed issues,” Rogers says. “We
are not taking a side; rather we would
like to see what the underlying values
are around these issues and how they
might vary across the community.”
As Rogers described in her proposal
to EPSCoR, this project uses an issue
of viewshed management that is cur-rently
of concern to people in the area
“to stimulate community
dialogs about the variety of
ecosystem services encom-passed
in a viewshed and their
associated values, including
both economic and non-economic
values.” Unlike other
visual impact assessments, this project
investigates the underlying values
that people have about views with the
intention of developing data that can
be helpful in decision making affecting
both viewsheds and the environment.
VIEWSHED
noun
First Known Use: 1981
A viewshed is an area of land, water,
or other environmental element that
is visible from a fixed vantage point.
Widely used in urban planning, the
term frequently refers to areas of
particular scenic or historic value that
are deemed worthy of preservation
against development or other
change. Preservation of viewsheds is
frequently a goal in the designation
of open space areas, green belts, and
community separators.

Rogers spent a couple of months
planning the project and developing a
proposal for EPSCoR. The grant allows
one undergraduate and one graduate
student to serve as research assistants
on the project; at the beginning of
March, Ashley Hyde (a graduate
student in the MS in Environmental
Science and Policy program) and
Rebecca Brown (an undergraduate
Environmental Science and Policy
major) began work on the pilot study.
Their first task was a literature
review and latent content analysis.
That means going over news reports,
records of public meetings, and other
documentation to identify repeating
themes that reflect the current range of
opinions. If many people are expressing
some version of a particular value, it’s
probably relevant. Using the informa-tion
they found during this initial pro-cess,
they worked with Rogers to design
questions that reflect those themes.
“The literature review step to this
study was really interesting,” Brown
says. “It allowed me to learn more
about viewsheds and the controversial
issues around wind farms in particu-lar.
It’s exciting to interview members
of the community to further under-stand
the public’s opinion on this new
technology. Hopefully our results will
lead to a better understanding about
the value of scenic views on a com-munity
level, which could be helpful in
policy making in the future.”
“Based on our literature review,”
says Hyde, “it’s clear that landscapes
are viewed in a holistic way and
that integration of ecological, eco-nomical,
and social values are key
to well-managed viewsheds. Social
attitudes toward wind farms are an
increasingly studied topic in Europe.
The Not in My Back Yard (NIMBY)
effect was a concept that surfaced
often. NIMBY suggests that there is
an attitude-behavior gap in which
people support the idea of wind power
but they do not support the idea of
having wind farms in their ‘backyard.’
It seems as though the locals who are
more likely to support wind farms
are those who were involved in a ‘fair’
planning process and had ownership
in the project from the beginning
development stages.”
Hyde attended the North Country
NH Listens discussion in Plymouth
in March as part of this preliminary
work. “We are only beginning to
scratch the surface of local attitudes
towards the Groton Wind Farm but
currently there seems to be mixed sup-port.
The discussion revealed a strong
desire to preserve New Hampshire’s
natural assets for multiple interests.”
Brown and Hyde are identifying a
small group of stakeholders—seven to
10 people with an interest in the topic
from towns surrounding the wind
farm, such as Groton, Rumney, and
Plymouth. With help and oversight
from Rogers, the students are conduct-ing
individual interviews with these
stakeholders, asking the questions
they’ve developed while leaving room
for new topics to arise naturally in
the course of conversation. If funding
allows, Rogers would like to follow
up the interviews with a community
workshop that would take place over
several hours and explore similar
questions to generate even more ideas
and perspectives.
Rogers and her team will use a
qualitative analysis software called
NVivo to draw out themes and
summarize responses. Qualitative
analysis is frequently used in the
social sciences to analyze data that is
difficult to put into numbers. Unlike
quantitative analysis, which focuses
on measurement for statistical,
mathematical, or computational
results, qualitative analysis helps
researchers to interpret data
from that hard-to-quantify
and often contradictory factor:
human beings.
Typically, qualitative research
involves focusing on smaller groups, as
in the Viewshed Valuation Pilot Study.
Since the number of people being
interviewed is relatively low, Rogers
points out that these responses can’t be
considered to represent the perspec-tives
of everyone in the community
but are useful in determining what the
different perspectives are. Small pilot
studies like this one are often used to
generate the data needed to pursue
larger, more comprehensive studies
down the road.
“It’s the opportunity to pursue
research like this that attracts stu-dents
to Plymouth State’s program in
Environmental Science and Policy,”
says CFE Director and Professor Joe
Boyer, who adds that in the past five
years, the program has grown to 120
student-majors. “We’re hoping they will
continue into the graduate program,
which can lead to academic careers or
better jobs in an agency or company.
Unlike other visual impact assessments, this project investigates the underlying
values that people have about views with the intention of developing data that can
be helpful in decision making affecting both viewsheds and the environment.

“It’s the opportunity
to pursue research
like this that attracts
students to Plymouth
State’s program in
Environmental Science
and Policy.”—CFE
Director Joe Boyer
Our graduate students don’t
only go back into academia but
back into the community.”
Boyer notes that from its inception
almost 10 years ago, the Center for
the Environment has had a three-part
focus: the environment, the economy,
and the community. Projects like
Rogers’s are a good example of that
focus, bringing together academics
from both science and sociology with
partners in the community. “The value
that the ecosystem provides to humans
isn’t always captured in economic
models,” he says. “Public perception
plays into how we manage the land and
water. What do people feel and how do
you deal with it? It’s hard for scientists
because it’s not clear cut. That’s where
sociology, anthropology, and psychol-ogy
come in.”
As a New Hampshire native, Rogers
understands the attachment residents
have to the scenic attractions of the
state. She was raised in Strafford,
between Concord and the Seacoast.
Her studies at Dartmouth and UNH
reflected her desire for an interdisci-plinary
approach to studying the envi-ronment,
one that, she says, recognized
that “humans are not separate from
the rest of the world.”
When a former Dartmouth col-league
told her about the opening
for an ecological economist at PSU’s
Center for the Environment, Rogers
was excited at the prospect of working
somewhere with a mission that so
closely matched her interests, as well
as the opportunity not only to stay
in her home state, but to work at “a
place that values place” she says, and
to work with Boyer, who also came to
Plymouth State for the beginning of
the fall 2012 semester.
Projects like Rogers’s Viewshed
Valuation Pilot Study, Boyer says, help
“reinforce that connection between
environment, economy, and commu-nity.
Environmental decision making
is complex because different groups
care about different things. Actively
engaging the community, even if the
final decision wasn’t their chosen
option, helps the public feel that the
process was inclusive. You hope that if
you have open-minded people involved
in the process, they’ll consider all the
options. Even adversaries can learn to
respect each other during an objective
review process.”

As an NCAA Division III school, Plymouth State is home to the true
student-athlete: the student who exhibits the same drive, dedication,
and commitment to excellence both in and out of the classroom;
who studies hard for a rewarding future; and plays for the love of the
game. PSU social work major Nora Galvin ’14, from Windham, New
Hampshire, is one such student.
As a student at Salem High, Galvin not only excelled in her studies
but also played both varsity basketball and varsity softball, the latter
under coach Harold Sachs, the winningest coach in New Hampshire
high school softball. Salem High is a big school with an outstanding
Class L softball program, and the team won the championship both
her freshman and senior years.
After high school, Galvin decided to follow in her sister Michaela’s
(class of 2012) footsteps and attend PSU. “I came up on the weekends
to visit Michaela,” Galvin recalls. “I got a good feeling being here.
Plymouth State is just the right size, and it’s a nice community.”
When it came time to choose which sport she would commit herself
to in college, Galvin chose softball, “after having a wonderful time
playing it in high school,” she says.
With her top grades and prowess on the field, Galvin makes balanc-ing
academics and athletics look easy, but she’s quick to point out that
it requires considerable advance planning and dedication. As a pitcher,
Galvin practices year-round, so she has to plan each day, hour by
hour, to include classes, study time, three to four hours of training and
practice, plus games. “Every night before I go to bed I think about what
the next day will look like and when I can get the work done—even the
projects that are due later in the semester,” she says.
Her planning clearly pays off. Last season, she was named to the
Little East Conference All-American Team and last fall, her GPA was a
perfect 4.0. Over the past two seasons, Galvin’s pitching has led PSU’s
softball team to numerous wins, and, as coach Bruce Addison notes,
“She has a gift to make everyone around her better, as a softball player
and more importantly, as a person. She always puts the team first.”
While PSU is one of about 450 Division III schools in the country,
Galvin says it’s her coaches and teammates who make being a student-athlete
here something special. “The beauty of being a student-athlete
at PSU is you’re among people who love the game and love to work
hard, and they are doing it for not just themselves, but also their team-mates.”—

ENHANCING TEACHING
THROUGH TECHNOLOGY
It’s 2013. Do you know where your classroom is? by Emilie Coulter
VIRTUAL PSU
5,000
online enrollments = 15,000
credit hours =
one-half of all online
programming offered by
the University System of
New Hampshire for
2012-13 academic year
Spring/Summer 2013 | Plymouth Magazine 21
Do you know where your class-room
is? For Plymouth State
students 15 years ago, the answer
would have been straightforward:
Hyde 301, Rounds 212, the Boyd
meteorology lab. Today, however,
technology has changed where—
and how—we learn and teach.
Your “classroom” may still be in
Hyde, but it could just as easily be
in your residence hall bedroom
or downtown Plymouth. You
could be in Montana or China.
You may come home from your
full-time job, eat dinner, and only
crack open the laptop at 9:30. Or
you may be sitting outside with
your tablet, observing a video
lecture created by your psychol-ogy
professor in preparation for
tomorrow’s class.
Online courses, social media,
ePortfolios—technology in the
classroom is constantly evolv-ing
and expanding. Ever more
efficient and clever e-learning
tools are continually being devel-oped.
But using mobile apps and
cloud-based systems is not just
about leveraging technology for
technology’s sake. There’s a place
for technology in the classroom
only if it serves the student and
elevates the material. As Scott
Robison, director of Learning
Technologies and Online
Education says, “We don’t want
technology to drive the change.
It’s up to the instructor to deter-mine
what the learning objectives
are, and then look at how certain
tools might get them there better,
faster, easier.”
DIGITAL PSU
As so often happens with major
transformations, one or two
pioneers must be willing to take
the initial risks. Fifteen years
ago, Professor of Business Bonnie
Bechard stepped into that role,
offering PSU’s first online course
for the MBA program. As a new
mother, Bechard was seeking a
way to integrate the demands
of her role as a parent with her
teaching career. “I was so excited
and motivated to try this new
thing,” she says, “and so deter-mined
to make it work.” Even so,
establishing the online solution
was a challenge. Technology was
slow, awkward, and sometimes
unsophisticated; many people
were still using dial-up. “It felt
very lonely and it felt very bold,”
Bechard says.
Fast forward to today: the
MBA program has been fully
online for a decade, attract-ing
professionals from China,
Romania, India, Sweden, the
Caribbean, and around the
world. It has been ranked in the
top twenty on the list of “Best
Online MBA Programs” in the
country by GetEducated.com,
the national guide to online col-leges.
And the MBA program is
just the tip of the online iceberg.
Four undergraduate degrees are
offered fully online as well as
on-site: Business Administration,
Communications and Media
Studies, Criminal Justice, and
Nursing (the completion program
for registered nurses). In her 2013
State of the University address,
PSU President Sara Jayne Steen
reported that this year, through
the College of Graduate Studies
and the Division of Online and
Continuing Studies, PSU had
5,000 online enrollments—for
15,000 credit hours, one-half of
all online programming offered
by the University System of New
Hampshire.
HIGH TECH AND HIGH TOUCH
One of the most common miscon-ceptions
about online education
and other technological infusions
into the classroom is that technol-ogy
diminishes the connection
between teacher and student.
Mark Fischler, professor of crimi-nal
justice, says, “Professors will
work just as hard to develop rela-tionships
with students as they do
face to face. We want to develop
community: strong relationships,
mentoring, and camaraderie
among the students.”
And as Robison notes,
Plymouth State is known for its
student-centered, “high-touch”
campus life. With technology
having become such a crucial
part of education, he asks, “How
do we communicate that sense of
community, where the campus
is located, the exceptionally
involved educators, the great
student services … how do we
translate that and draw in stu-dents
from out of state or out of
the country?” Using carefully
vetted online resources
allows faculty to reach
everyone in—and outside
of—the classroom.
Plymouth State faculty are
adept at researching, selecting,
and even designing the tools
that work best for their courses
and students. Many faculty
use open-source conferencing
systems like Big Blue Button, for
example, which allows instructors
to present practicums and hold
meetings with their students
remotely. Others find innovative
ways of presenting classes to
distant learners. When one of
counselor education professor
Hridaya Hall’s clinical mental
health counseling students,
Philip Meher ’12G, was deployed
to Kuwait in 2011, he was able
to continue with his practicum
coursework via Skype and
Moodle (PSU’s virtual learning
management system). Meher was
even able to take part in real-time
weekly group supervisions, a
requirement of clinical mental
health accreditation. Hall says,
“His Plymouth peers’ educational
experience was greatly enriched
as they were able to interact with
a peer in an active deployment
setting and learn about unique
issues facing soldiers.” Meher cur-rently
serves as an Army chaplain
with the NH National Guard
and a readjustment-counseling
therapist working with combat
veterans from all eras including
Vietnam. Completing his course-work
online allowed him to get
into the workforce sooner: “I
could not have begun my intern-ship
in September 2011 if I had
not been able to do this practicum
while overseas,” Meher says.
Hall continually seeks other
ways to improve her students’
campus-based and online experi-ences
through technology. While
looking for a better approach to
sharing feedback with students
on their work, she discovered
a video screen/picture capture
22 Plymouth State University | plymouth.edu
program called Camtasia. With
a student’s paper on her screen,
she turns on Camtasia’s screen-and
audio-capture feature and
begins scrolling through her
rubric, explaining why they got
the scores they did, and provid-ing
feedback in the paper itself,
page by page, by pointing with
her cursor and recording her
voice. She then sends the student
the Word document and video.
Students can download the
video files and listen to feedback
as many times as necessary on
their computer, smartphone, or
any other portable media player.
“It’s been well-received,” Hall
says. “Students receive and
respond to feedback with
Camtasia better than when
it’s just written on their
papers. They feel more encour-aged
to make improvements
and understand how to go about
doing so. The process feels more
conversational, and I have more
confidence that the message I’m
sending, and my supportive tone,
are not lost in translation.”
GREATER ACCESS TO
EDUCATION
A major advantage of technology
is that it allows different types of
learners to access traditional—
and nontraditional—curricula
through the Internet. Online
education can be asynchronous,
meaning that the information is
shared outside the constraints
of time and place. This greatly
increases the flexibility and
availability of education to all
learners. Trent Boggess, dean
of the College of Business
Administration, believes that
online education is, simply,
“diversification of delivery
techniques. You get the same
great professors, teaching the
same great courses, online as well
as in person.” What’s different
circulate links to resources.
“Facebook right now is a very rel-evant
tool for marketers,” she says,
“so I think it’s important to know
the tool. I’ve found that by using
Facebook I get a much richer
interaction with students on an
almost 24/7 basis.” Plus, Dautcher
says, since so many of the students
are already using Facebook
socially, its use academically is
almost seamless: “When you pop
open your [personal] page there’s
a notification that something’s
been posted over in your class.”
KEEPING THE SMART IN
SMARTPHONES
The ubiquitous smartphone is
another tech tool faculty are
co-opting from students’ purely
social use. When the town of
Plymouth asked PSU’s history
department if students could
come up with a project to help
celebrate the town’s 250th anni-versary
this year, history profes-sor
Linda Upham-Bornstein and
her Public History students were
eager to bring history to the pub-lic
in a dynamic, forward-looking
way. “When students choose a
history career,” Upham-Bornstein
says, “the frustration is that it can
seem so insular or book-oriented.
How can you apply it to the real
world?” In addition to study-ing
the field of public history,
students in this class are expected
to learn about technology that’s
appropriate for a twenty-first
century career in history.
Upham-Bornstein and her
students were inspired by the
possibilities they researched for
the project, including several
emerging apps that tie historical
photos and/or information to
Google Maps. One of the apps,
called Field Trip, runs in the
background on a smartphone.
When users get close to an inter-esting
historical site, a notifica-tion
pops up with details about
the location. “With these
apps and tools,” Upham-
Bornstein says, “history
is not static, it’s not just a
book; it’s something you
can participate in, interact
with. It gets people thinking of
history in a different way.”
Ultimately, the students chose
a layered solution—creating a QR
code tour of Plymouth and incor-porating
Field Trip—that was
accessible to the broadest possible
audience, from locals to out-of-towners.
Students delved into
the stories behind Plymouth’s
iconic architecture, culture, and
sculpture, using oral histories
and background research to cre-ate
entertaining and informative
Web pages on the Plymouth
town site. They designed the site
with geotags that allowed Field
Trip to work with the specific
Plymouth locations. The young
historians then assigned QR
codes to the structures, including
the Daniel Webster Courthouse,
the Plymouth Railroad Station,
and the Congregational Church.
Visitors scan the code with their
smartphone or other imaging
device, which interprets the
symbol and instantly directs the
viewer to the website (onthisspot.
org). Students worked closely
with geography faculty member
John Lennon, who not only
consulted with Plymouth State’s
information technology staff
to determine changes that
needed to be made to the Town of
Plymouth’s Wordpress blog, but
is that students can receive
some of the material on their
own time, through their own
devices, and can participate in
a multitude of ways, not simply
in a classroom setting: they can
virtually raise their hand (with a
click on an icon) and speak in an
e-conference, text their profes-sors,
Facebook chat with class-mates,
or collaborate on projects
with international peers through
cloud-based sharing systems.
FAMILIAR TECH TOOLS LEAD
TO NEW WAYS OF TEACHING
With so many e-learning tools
emerging, sometimes it’s the
“old” standbys students are
already using that end up being
the most effective learning
tools. Faculty use YouTube, for
example, to post recorded videos
of their lectures for students to
view at their convenience. When
students attend class the next day,
they are prepared to discuss what
they have learned. This model
is sometimes called the “flipped
classroom,” or “reverse instruc-tion.”
Rather than spending
class time listening to a lecture,
students spend this time together
applying their new knowledge
and problem solving.
With more than a billion
subscribers worldwide, Facebook
is a networking site faculty can
be confident their students know
well. Business faculty member
Terri Dautcher uses Facebook
when teaching her marketing
classes. Through a private group
her students share documents,
chat, brainstorm ideas, and
Spring/Summer 2013 | Plymouth Magazine 23
also communicated directly with
Google regarding this and other
PSU projects.
Upham-Bornstein sees stu-dents
as the perfect link between
history and the public in projects
like the Plymouth tour: “You
have the town partnering with
the students in a very positive
way to give back to the town
something they really want.”
ENGAGING STUDENTS
The interactivity and intercon-nectedness
of today’s online
systems allows students to more
actively participate in their
learning. Students who tend to
be reticent in a classroom set-ting
are often far more open to
discourse in the relative security
of an online setting. Students
who hold down full- or part-time
jobs appreciate the flexibility of
online or blended classrooms,
which allow them to give their
full attention to their schoolwork
when it best fits their schedule.
And variations on the traditional
schedule and delivery modes can
allow more time for any student
to do field work, process infor-mation
during the times they are
most receptive, and operate in a
familiar digital landscape.
What amazing new app is
waiting in the wings? What inno-vative
system will revolutionize
learning? Time—and at the rate
technology evolves, not much of
it—will tell. The one thing we can
be sure of is that technology will
continue to advance and PSU
faculty will always be ready to
make it their own.
PSU students Kyle Martin and Kayla
Claire demonstrate how smartphone
apps and QR codes reveal the stories
behind iconic Plymouth landmarks.

FROM THE PRESIDENT’S COUNCIL
Aiming High for ALLWell
“The ALLWell Center is the Univer-sity’s
highest capital priority,” said
President’s Council member and
chair of the ALLWell II Commit-tee
Eric Huttner, father of Jared ’06.
The Active Living, Learning, and
Wellness (ALLWell) Center is a mul-tifaceted
academic and athletic com-plex
that will transform Plymouth
State University through expanded
academic programs and new oppor-tunities
for research, enhanced ath-letic
and recreational activities, and
additional ways to engage in commu-nity
partnerships.
Huttner and 10 other members of
the President’s Council created the
ALLWell II Committee to partner
with University Advancement’s major
gifts team to raise the $2.5 million in
gifts needed for the second phase that
includes an expansive field house,
classrooms, and laboratories.
“It’s an exciting opportunity for
donors who want to have a big impact
on the future at PSU,” said Huttner.
The President’s Council has played
an important role in securing private
support for the ALLWell Center’s first
phase, the PSU Ice Arena and Savage
Welcome Center, from individuals
and businesses. “President’s Council
members can be proud to see how
their own gifts and their work with
donors have resulted in the arena’s
transformative impact on the Univer-sity
and the community,” said Vice
President for University Advancement
Sally Holland. “The ALLWell II Com-mittee
members are engaging with
alumni, friends, and other donors
who understand the need to replace
the PE Center with facilities that
reflect changing academic require-ments
and expanded enrollments.”
University System of New Hampshire
alumni trustee and founding mem-ber
of the President’s Council Wally
Stevens observed, “The Board of
Trustees recognizes the huge impact
ALLWell will have on Plymouth
State’s academic programs, especially
Bringing His Talents Home: Dave Poulin ’85 Joins President’s Council
“The direction in which Plymouth
State is moving … the initiatives
for the future … that feeling I get
when I’m back on campus.” This is
what motivated David Poulin ’85
to become more deeply involved
with his alma mater. As the newest
member of the President’s Council,
Poulin brings enthusiasm, energy,
and commitment to the 22-member
volunteer organization that works to
advance the University’s mission by
advocating for its future and secur-ing
private support.
Poulin, a physical education major
and four-year player on Plymouth
State’s football team, is now a senior
vice president and senior investment
management consultant with the
Bay Colony Group at Morgan Stan-ley.
He and his wife, Monica, live
in Wayland, MA, with their three
children. His commitment to ath-letics
and fitness are evident in his
community service involvements:
youth sports like Pop Warner Foot-ball,
baseball, softball, the Pan Mass
Challenge bike ride to raise funds
for the Jimmy Fund and Dana Far-ber
Cancer Institute, and Friends of
Plymouth State Football.
Q: How has your relationship to
Plymouth State evolved in the 28
years since you graduated?
A: I’ve always loved this place.
The close-knit PE department [now
expanded as the Department of Health
and Human Performance with 15
different undergraduate and gradu-ate
degree programs] gave me a solid
start. My college friends and team-mates
have turned out to be my best
friends—we have been together more
than 30 years. We used to come back
for football games, but then our priori-ties
shifted with growing responsibili-ties
to family and career. Two years
ago, I connected with John Scheinman
from University Advancement and
began to see the positive initiatives
the University was undertaking. John
recognized in me a desire to help,
especially with the ALLWell Center,
and put me in touch with President
Steen and [Council Chair] Larry
Haynes. Serving on the President’s
Council was the next right step in my
lifelong relationship with PSU.
in health and human performance,
its third largest major. Those stu-dents
go on to pursue careers in the
health professions, which are criti-cally
important to New Hampshire.
The state is experiencing a steady and
rapid increase in demand for highly
qualified practitioners in the health
and wellness fields.”
Stevens continued, “As PSU has
developed this project over the last
several years, the trustees repeatedly
have affirmed the ALLWell Center as
the University System’s highest pri-ority
for construction projects.”
Huttner added, “With the efforts of
the volunteers and the generosity of
alumni, parents, and friends we’ll
reach 100 percent of our goal.”

Center and how you can be a
part of the University’s vision for the
future, contact John Scheinman

A: It’s important because it’s the
only option! New facilities will make
us competitive—for students, for great
athletes, and especially in the health
and human performance disciplines.
The ALLWell Center truly benefits
the entire University community. The
ice arena and welcome center, the first
phase of the plan, has already changed
the social dynamics of the campus and
the community. I’m excited about it
and feel this is something alumni can
get behind. It’s an opportunity we have
to change the University for the next 50
years. As a member of the President’s
Council, I want to help bring alumni
together for a common cause that posi-tively
impacts the future PSU.
Q: Have you identified any com-mon
threads in the alumni and donor
population of your generation?
A: I see a yearning of my genera-tion
to get back together, to get back
to PSU, to reconnect. That’s where
the idea for the new Boston Business
Forum came from. We reached out
to alumni who work in business and
live in the Boston area, putting them
in touch with the great things hap-pening
at the University like the new
Enterprise Center, and reconnecting
them with people they used to know
and others they need to know—all
through Plymouth State. People from
PSU want to do business with others
from PSU. If we can ignite pockets
of alumni like this, we will be able to
change lives like ours were changed
when we first walked on campus
many years ago.

Spring/Summer 2013 | Plymouth Magazine 29
Surrounded by computer
servers and Apple laptops in a
red-carpeted lab between the
players’ locker room and the court,
Dan Craig ’03 represents one of the
emerging twenty-first-century power
centers in professional basketball: he’s
the video coordinator and assistant
coach for the defending champion
Miami Heat. Utilizing multiple
camera angles and sophisticated
editing software, he creates fast,
bite-sized visual narratives out of
players’ tendencies and strengths and
weaknesses—on-demand scouting
and coaching tools that take the
limited perspective of the bench to
another dimension.
Heading out of his senior year
at Plymouth State, Craig landed
an internship in the Heat’s video
department in the summer of 2003.
He was brought back the following
year to work full-time under the
assistant coach in charge of the team’s
video department, Eric Spoelstra, who
subsequently became Miami’s head
coach. Spoelstra knows intimately the
value and challenge of Craig’s work.
He told a reporter for the Palm Beach
Post that the role has become more
demanding in recent years. “The job
entails so much more technology, and
none of us are technology guys. We’re
basketball guys that have to learn and
grind out technology.”
Craig is no stranger to grinding it
out. A star schoolboy point guard
from Chelmsford, MA, the five-foot-six
Craig saw his varsity career at
Plymouth cut short by knee injuries.
Despite playing just four games over
his final two seasons, Craig won
the Coach’s Award as a junior and
co-captained the team both years.
Then-coach John Scheinman (now
in University Advancement) calls
him a “special player and a special
person, a leader on the team who
knew even in high school that he
wanted to be a head coach some day.”
Craig briefly took a position as grad
assistant at Bloomsburg University in
Pennsylvania. “I thought that would
be the route,” Craig told a reporter this
past March, following Miami’s 22nd
straight victory. “Then the Heat called.”
Craig says the biggest impact that
Plymouth had in preparing him for his
career came through the examples
of character he saw in his professors
and coaches, and the willingness
of Scheinman to take a student like
him under his wing and expose him
to coaching at the college level. He
stays in near-constant touch with
Scheinman, Athletic Director John
Clark ’71, ’73G, and other coaches
at Plymouth. They’ve kept him up to
speed on the University’s plans for
enhancing the athletic facilities. “It’s
exciting to hear what they’re doing,”
says Craig. “I can’t wait to see it
come together. But despite my job,
I’m actually a little old-school. What
matters to me most is that Plymouth
cares about and supports athletics.
What makes Plymouth Plymouth is
the people.”— Jim Collins

Magazine and author of The Last Best
League, is a freelance writer living in
Orange, NH.
“I met my husband my first night on

Sam Wisel Joins Alma Mater as Annual
Fund Coordinator
“PLYMOUTH STATE HAS GIVEN ME MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO
GROW, AS WELL AS A WONDERFUL EDUCATION,” says Sam Wisel ’12,
the University’s new Annual Fund coordinator.
Throughout his four-year experience at Plymouth
State, Wisel was no stranger to philanthropy or to
giving back to the community. He served on the
boards of Pemi-Valley Habitat for Humanity and
the Student Support Foundation, traveled to the
southern US with Alternative Spring Break, and
went to Bolivia with the International Service Trip
in 2012.
After an internship with the Spaulding Youth
Center, assisting with marketing and fundraising
efforts, Wisel served as PSU’s first advancement
fellow, where his responsibilities included managing
the Annual Fund Calling Program. He notes, “Our
student calling program has been a key component
in increasing alumni gifts to the Annual Fund.
Student callers also enjoy talking with alumni and
learning about their experiences at Plymouth State,
and sharing news about the University as it is today.
Over the past year, more than 200 new donors have made gifts to the Annual
Fund, and we hope alumni will continue to support the University and invest in
higher education for our students.”
About his new role, Wisel says, “I look forward to working with our alumni
and donors to ensure that all students can access the wide range of academic
and enrichment opportunities that I found so valuable during my experience at
Plymouth State.”— Heidi Pettigrew ’99, ’07G, ’11CAGS

Alumni Mentors: Building Connections and Benefitting Students
“Bringing students and alumni
together allows for real and mean-ingful
connections,” says Jim Kuras,
Plymouth State’s new career services
manager. With more than 20 years
of career services experience, Kuras
has seen significant changes in the
way career services are delivered on
college campuses, especially with the
rise of social media.
One common method in the field is
to bring together current students
with alumni mentors, a natural
source of advice and experience since
alumni share a strong common bond
with students. Kuras says, “In addi-tion
to helping students move for-ward
in their career exploration, an
alumni mentor enhances his or her
own leadership and coaching skills
and connects with what’s happening
at Plymouth State.”
Kuras teaches a section of Profes-sional
Employment for PSU’s College
of Business Administration, a course
designed to help students develop the
skills needed to succeed in the work-place,
such as professional behavior,
networking, and the job search. He
quickly realized that the class would
be the perfect opportunity to explore
the possibilities of pairing undergrad-uate
students with alumni mentors at
Plymouth State.
This spring, Kuras put the idea into
motion with a small pilot group.
“During their degree programs, stu-dents
develop leadership, relationship
building, critical thinking, communi-cation,
and other skills,” says Kuras.
“Alumni mentors can help students
understand how portable those skills
are, and how they can leverage what
they’ve learned at Plymouth State
throughout their careers.” Students
and alumni mentors meet virtually or
in-person, depending on the alumni
mentor’s location, three or four times
throughout the semester.
For the fall, Kuras is recruiting 15
more alumni mentors to pair with
students. “We’re looking for profes-sionals
from a variety of fields who
understand what it takes for recent
graduates to be successful in any
employment situation,” he notes.
Director of Alumni Relations Rodney
Ekstrom ’09G adds, “Working across
the country and in nearly every
career field, alumni have so much
to offer our current students. We’re
excited to partner with Career Ser-vices
on this opportunity. Alumni-student
interactions such as this are
so important, as it allows alumni to
serve by sharing their expertise to
support students, regardless of career
path.”—Heidi Pettigrew

ol’ days than actually being back on campus with those with whom you spent

As a sophomore, Chelsea Desrochers ’13
enrolled in a course that explored issues of
culture, poverty, social development, and
social justice, and culminated in a service
trip to the Dominican Republic. “Seeing
the poverty and the lack of education and
resources was shocking,” she says, noting that
it was also life-changing. “I started planning
the rest of my education and future around
what I experienced and learned.”
In the spring, Chelsea and other students
raised money for a summer service trip
to Nicaragua by doing yard work in the
community. This fall, she will begin working
toward her master’s degree in public health,
with the goal of improving the quality of life
and health for others.
Chelsea says that the scholarships and
financial support she received from PSU

transformation from student to humanitarian.
“Thank you for believing in students like me.”

Redefining
the Educational
Landscape
ALLWell North’s Outdoor Center was fea-tured
on Homecoming weekend with the
formal dedication of the Brennan C. Hart
’85 Outdoor Education Planning Room. The
ceremony highlighted the outsize impact
on PSU students that the John and Elizabeth
Hart family has made, both through their
capital gift to ALLWell North and the en-dowed
scholarship fund they established in
1987 to memorialize their son and brother
Brennan Hart ’85, who died in a bicycle
accident a week before graduation. The
Hart family, past recipients of the Brennan
Hart ’85 Scholarship, and many Class of ’85
alumni attended the dedication.
The Harts’ initial $10,000 gift has grown to
be one of PSU’s largest lump-sum schol-arships.
For Brennan’s twin brother David
Hart ’85, the fund’s target is especially
rewarding: “We specifically wanted the
scholarships to help people who aren’t ‘A’
students. It’s important to my family to en-able
leaders and achievers who aren’t at the
top of their class to pursue what they love.”
Of the 50+ scholarships awarded since
1987, the impact on lives is immeasurable.

“CHANGE IS THE LAW
OF LIFE. AND THOSE
WHO LOOK ONLY TO
THE PAST OR PRESENT
ARE CERTAIN TO MISS
THE FUTURE,” former
president John F. Kennedy
once commented. This
trenchant observation
could easily be the rallying
cry for Plymouth State
President Donald Birx,
who is currently leading
the University through a
wholesale transformation
that meets the future with
open arms.

“The faculty and
administration
have always had a
remarkable ability
to look to the future
and envision the
possibilities that lie
ahead, and we’re once
more on the cusp of
something new.”
Under President Donald Birx’s
leadership, Plymouth State is making
a dramatic shift in administration and
pedagogy, moving from a traditional university
model to an integrated, interdisciplinary,
cluster-based model that Birx believes will
give students the combination of education
and engaged scholarship necessary to compete
successfully in an increasingly complex and
interdisciplinary world.
Building on our strengths
Birx acknowledges that the undertaking is
immense, encompassing both the academic
and administrative aspects of the University,
but he’s confident that Plymouth State is up to
the challenge. “The move to integrated clusters
builds on the things that Plymouth State and
this region have always been good at—an
interdisciplinary and integrated approach to
education.” The institution has built a reputa-tion
for responding astutely to changing times
and needs throughout its history, he points
out. It started as a teachers college, became a
training ground for business, and then mor-phed
again into a regional, comprehensive
university. “The faculty and administration
have always had a remarkable ability to look
to the future and envision the possibilities that
lie ahead, and we’re once more on the cusp of
something new. We will be on the forefront
of higher education, leveraging our strengths
both institutionally and regionally, and doing
something really impactful by giving our stu-dents
an educational experience that’s different
than one they can get anywhere else.”
To understand how this wholesale trans-formation
will take place, says Birx, think of
putting together a puzzle. “I don’t start in the
middle, because I don’t yet understand the
framework in which pieces fit together into a
coherent image. Instead, I frame the outline
and build clusters of pieces that look like they
go together, and lastly add the connecting
pieces that draw the whole image together.”
Birx initiated the framing process a little
over a year ago, shortly after he entered the
president’s office in July of 2015. Now, after
numerous conversations among faculty,
staff, alumni, and donors, the University has
identified seven academic clusters within
which all degree programs will be organized:
Arts &amp; Technologies; Education, Democracy
&amp; Social Change; Exploration &amp; Discovery;
Health &amp; Human Enrichment; Innovation
&amp; Entrepreneurship; Justice &amp; Security;
and Tourism, Environment &amp; Sustainable
Development. “These integrated clusters were
picked very carefully to build on the strengths
of the University as well as the region,” Birx
notes. “They also recreate an integrated per-spective
of a liberal arts education that features
engaged scholars and promotes transdisci-plinary
project-based learning, something I
believe was lost to some extent during the last
two centuries of increasing specialization and
focus on discipline-based skills.”
An ideal environment
Fundamental conceptually, Birx con-tinues,
are the ideas of “Exploration &amp;
Discovery” through to “Innovation &amp;
4 Plymouth Magazine | Fall 2016
RAYMOND BURTON ’62 OPEN LABORATORY, LAMSON LIBRARY
“It has been noted that entrepreneurs innovate because they see problems as opportunities,
and there’s an openness to exploring, creating, discovering, and leading at Plymouth State
that make it an ideal environment for this approach to learning.”—Donald Birx
Entrepreneurship”—the quest to explore ideas
and then apply them. These concepts, which
arguably are a part of each of the clusters, are
highlighted here to bring together the STEM
and business disciplines into the fold of a
strong liberal arts education. In this context,
he explains, entrepreneurship is not really a
business concept, but a call to action. Those
who learn to think entrepreneurially are more
comfortable with risk and ambiguity and more
willing to learn as they go. “It has been noted
that entrepreneurs innovate because they see
problems as opportunities,” Birx observes, “and
there’s an openness to exploring, creating,
discovering, and leading at Plymouth State that
make it an ideal environment for this approach
to learning.”
University environments are naturally rich
settings in which to create and explore, says
Birx, and Plymouth State has the added ben-efit
of being situated in a region of abundant
resources, with numerous assets available
within a two-hour radius of the University.
“We have individuals who have brought their
expertise to this region from all over the
world; they’re drawn by the natural beauty
and the proximity to resources up and down
the Eastern seaboard,” he notes. Many of the
University’s faculty comes from richly varied
backgrounds including business, industry,
education, government, et cetera, making
them natural proponents for the real-world
learning integrated clusters entail. “We are
ideally positioned to turn Plymouth State into
a hotbed of activity for creative ideas and con-cepts,”
Birx enthuses.
The University’s size also makes it well
suited to the integrated clusters model. With
approximately 4,100 undergraduates and
2,000 graduate students, Plymouth State is
large enough to support such an integrated
approach to learning, while at the same time
small enough to make the structural changes
necessary to facilitate the interconnected
nature of the enterprise. Organizing the
institution around integrated clusters will not
only encourage exchanges across academic
disciplines, but also streamline administrative
processes and empower those closest to the
points where decisions need to be made.
To guide students through the new inte-grated
cluster approach to education, we are
discussing four tools: a first-year seminar,
open laboratories, themed general education,
and an integrative capstone project. The first-year
seminar would engage incoming students
with an introduction to the cluster learning
process by posing a ‘challenge’ that must be
solved through cross-disciplinary work with
students in other disciplines and possibly with
individuals from the community, including
those in business, industry, and non-profits.
Project-based learning can take place in open
laboratories, spaces that encourage interac-tions
among students, faculty, and staff as well
as practitioners and those interested in the
application of entrepreneurial ideas to real-world
challenges.
Additionally, first-year students are being
assigned success coaches who will guide them
in mapping out a program of study within
their chosen discipline as well as hopefully
identifying four to five cluster areas that will
provide breadth and key skills to help them
along their chosen career path. For exam-ple,
a freshman might enter the University
seeking an arts degree and over the course of
four years take a series of general education
courses that span the Arts &amp; Technologies
cluster such as writing, digital media, gaming,
or graphic design; or a course sequence in
Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and/or sus-tainability
and resiliency. At the end of four
years, the student would complete a capstone
project to solve a challenge and demonstrate
what has been learned over the past four years.
“Our goal is for students to find their passion
while at the same time discovering how their
interests fit in with the challenges and needs
of the twenty-first century global economy,”
Birx explains.
For those who may wonder if such an
approach works as well in practice as in theory,
Birx offers up two examples: The University of
Twente in the Netherlands and Great Britain’s
University of Cambridge. Twente is located
in the community of Enschede, a former
mill community that by the late 1950s found
itself struggling in the wake of international
competition. In 1961, the community coun-tered
the downturn by launching a university
with a novel twist: students were required to
develop a mini-business plan during their
course of study and were schooled in a major,
integrative business skills, and the interdis-ciplinary
collaborations that are common to
the real world. “Each time a student started a
company, a tree was planted,” says Birx, “and,
just 50 years later, there’s both a forest and a
thriving business community. The richness of
the environment is inspiring and the effects on
the community have been transformational,
socially and economically.”
The creative fermentation at the University
of Cambridge has been similarly profound,
Birx notes. “Cambridge students from a host
of disciplines live, eat, and sleep together—you
can have a political scientist living next to
an engineer—and the opportunities for the
cross-pollination of ideas are legion. In fact,
Trinity College of the University of Cambridge
has had 32 Nobel laureates and integrative
thinkers such as Isaac Newton, Alfred Lord
Tennyson, and Charles Babbage,” he observes
in a rush of enthusiasm.
Plymouth State University | plymouth.edu/magazine 5
Enthusiastic support
Although Plymouth State’s transformation to
integrated clusters is in its nascent stages—the
marketing campaign officially got underway in
November—initial responses have been good.
The University System of New Hampshire
(USNH) Board of Trustees offered a full-throated
endorsement, voting unanimously
to support Birx’s strategic vision. Parents and
prospective students have also voiced support
for the change. “I’ve had the chance to meet
visiting students and their parents, explain
the integrated clusters concept, and preview a
couple of our new open labs, and they’ve been
incredibly excited,” says Birx. “Parents and
students have told me ‘This makes so much
sense—this is how the world works. This is
what we’ve been looking for!’”
Alumni, too, have voiced their approval for
the integrated cluster model. Nick Vailas ’76, a
wellness and healthcare consultant and former
director of the New Hampshire Department
of Health and Human Services, lauds the
interdisciplinary nature of the concept and
is particularly enthusiastic about the ‘Health
&amp; Human Enrichment’ cluster. “Breaking
down academic silos through integrated
clusters and open labs provides allied health
students greater interaction with healthcare
professionals and a better understanding of
the continuity of patient care,” he says. “This
will increase efficiencies, save time and money
and, most importantly, ensure better out-comes
for patients.”
Current PSU students have also had the
opportunity to experience the power of the
integrated cluster approach. In November of
2015, the University hosted a collaborative
project based on a work of art by Christine
Destrempes, founder and director of Art &amp;
Dialogue, a nonprofit organization dedicated
to raising awareness and promoting dialogue
around the shrinking availability of clean
water as a result of climate change, access, and
commercial exploitation. Working with faculty
and students, Destrempes installed 10,000
Steps: Exploring Our Footprint and Her Long
Walk for Water—a piece designed to create
awareness of the struggle for access to water
that affects nearly 800 million people around
the world—on Plymouth State’s campus. In
the months leading up to the installation,
students from the departments of art, envi-ronmental
science and policy, and philosophy
worked alongside a group of international
students to formulate activities, align curricula,
and develop marketing materials related to the
project and to global water issues.
The results were immediate and profound.
Working side by side with art students, phi-losophy
and history major Courtney Smith ’17
discovered that adding a visual element to the
learning process amplified understanding in
ways she hadn’t anticipated. Working across
disciplines also increased Smith’s appreciation
for collaborative learning. “I’m applying to
graduate schools now and have been looking
for programs that are more interdisciplinary in
nature than those I had previously considered,”
she says.
Philosophy major Joshua Butler ’17 was
similarly impacted. “It was a great experience.
I found it extraordinarily beneficial to say, ‘OK,
here’s what I’ve learned in the classroom, and
here’s how I can apply that knowledge.’” Butler
says he learned how to interact with those
in other fields of study and, perhaps more
importantly, realized that it was okay to ask
for help, a takeaway that he characterizes as
one of the most important lessons to come out
of academia. “I know now that when I enter a
debate, it’s not helpful to shut people down—if
you listen to others and communicate in a way
that’s beneficial to both parties, it’s a lot easier
to resolve conflicts, a lesson I think is espe-cially
relevant in today’s society.” Butler says he
also took great pride in contributing to such a
massive project. “I felt as though I helped by
heightening people’s awareness of water issues.
I’m pursuing the study of philosophy in order
to help people, and I feel as though this experi-ence
validated my choice.”
“As the project progressed and the stu-dents
saw their products in relation to other
students’ work, the effect of the interdisci-plinary
approach became clearer and energy,
enthusiasm and support increased,” observes
Drerup Gallery Director Cynthia Robinson.
“What we learned through 10,000 Steps was
that together we can assemble a deep, rich,
innovative, engaging, and powerful learning
experience for students.”
Experiences such as these are precisely
what Birx is hoping the integrated clusters
model will foster. Coming from the research
world, Birx says he encountered many people
who were deeply engrossed in their areas of
specialization and often unaware of the inter-play
of extradisciplinary ideas. Consequently,
they were prone to making more incremental
changes rather than the integrative leaps that
the challenges of our increasingly complex
world demand. “In order to succeed as a
nation, we must champion creativity and
innovation, and as a university, we must
foster an environment that facilitates those
qualities and allows people to synthesize
information across disciplines.”

The Center for Business and
Community Partnerships
Fostering collaboration with regional partners
A cornerstone of the clusters initiative is the drive to create
an integrated learning environment in which PSU students
can collaborate with community members to solve real-world
challenges. From the time they enter the University, students will
have the opportunity to work side-by-side in open laboratories
with practitioners in business, industry, government, and
non-profit agencies, seeking solutions that benefit both the
University and the region.
At Plymouth State, these interactions are facilitated by the
Center for Business and Community Partnerships (CBCP), which
supports collaborative and reciprocal relationships among
students, faculty, and an off-campus network of industry partners
from both the commercial and not-for-profit sectors. By linking
PSU faculty and students with external partners, the CBCP fosters
initiatives that have significant intellectual, social, cultural,
scientific, and economic outcomes.
According to CBCP Director Ben Amsden, community
enthusiasm for the clusters initiative is high. “This semester
the center has received 70 external inquiries and is currently
facilitating active partnerships involving 103 organizations, 190
students, and 22 faculty/staff.” Organizations that are currently
partnering with PSU include the Appalachian Mountain
Club, the New Hampshire Electric Co-op, the New Hampshire
Department of Resources and Economic Development, and the
White Mountain National Forest.
“The clusters initiative is incredibly exciting,” says Grafton
Regional Development Corporation CEO Chris Wellington.
“We welcome the opportunity to get Plymouth State students
more engaged with the business community. Not only do we
feel that hands-on experiences will prove beneficial to them,
but we also believe the clusters and open laboratories have the
potential to improve the workforce issues this region is currently
facing. Attracting and maintaining a young workforce is one of
the largest issues facing central and northern New Hampshire
at the moment, so making connections between students and
members of our business community is critical. I can’t wait to see
new collaborative projects get underway.”

Birx acknowledges that the undertaking
is large, but he is certain that the students,
faculty, staff, alumni, donors, and commu-nity
members who comprise PSU and its
environs will rise to the occasion. In fact, he’s
so confident of the collective community’s
abilities to meet the challenges ahead that he
has committed the University to the Climate
Reality Project’s ‘100% Committed’ Campaign,
pledging that by 2030, Plymouth State will be
powered by 100% renewable electricity. “It’s
an impossible mission, yet it’s a great cluster
project for precisely that reason. These types of
challenges create an incubating environment
where great things can happen. The task will
draw together individuals from across the
University community and force us to ask,
‘How can we synthesize ideas in order to inno-vate
successfully?’ 100% Committed offers a
perfect vehicle for creating and engendering
the type of thinking that the integrated clus-ters
model is predicated upon.”
Birx is eager to get both this challenge
and his bigger mission underway. “Once the
concept starts to coalesce and the integrated
clusters start self-reinforcing, we’ll really begin
to pick up speed,” he concludes. “Witnessing
the transformation to this new learning model
here at Plymouth State will be like witnessing a
phase change. When water changes from a liq-uid
to a solid, crystals begin to form and then
exponential growth leads to a sheet of ice—a
solid, cohesive unit. It’s a perfect metaphor for
the holistic, synergistic change we’re striving
for in the integrated clusters approach to
learning here at Plymouth State—where what
each of us does reinforces everything else and
where each of us has a role in the final result.” ■

collaborative, interdisciplinary
work that transcends individual
disciplines and thus, breaks down
those silos. Integrated clusters are
academic homes for faculty, stu-dents,
staff, programs, curricula,
research, and projects. Through
these clusters, we will engage with
partners from the community
and beyond. Our partners will
benefit from our integrative
infrastructure. We are modeling
integrative thinking between dis-ciplines
and across clusters both
on and off campus.
By organizing academic affairs
in this way, we envision possi-bilities
for collaboration across
disciplines and across clusters.
What we imagine might involve
research, evolving our curricula
to meet the needs of the future,
developing specific projects,
finding innovative ways to partner
with external publics, and getting
students out of the classroom to
be involved with ideas in action,
multiple disciplines, and solving
real-world problems. Through this
integrative experience, students
see how working with others leads
to broader understanding of how
to solve problems collaboratively.
By situating integrated clusters
as the primary organizing struc-ture
in academic affairs, we break
down silos, enabling students
and faculty to see the interface
between disciplines. Additionally,
by having an integrative organiza-tional
infrastructure, we can work
more effectively and efficiently
across all facets of the institution.
Some new features of this
vision involve developing open
lab spaces, a physical or virtual
space that supports integrated
clusters engagement. We believe
these kinds of experiences
better prepare our students to
be engaged citizens when they
graduate. PSU students will be
integrative thinkers who are
able to collaborate and be
responsible active agents in
their chosen fields.
Leading the way
Plymouth is distinguishing itself
from other institutions. We are
the first institution to take this
path of re-imagining all of the
work of our institution, and I
believe we will be successful in at
least two fundamental ways.
First, integrated clusters will
make us stand out among higher
education institutions, which
will cultivate our economic
sustainability. Second, and more
importantly, we are changing the
higher education landscape one
integrated cluster idea at a time.
In a few years, other institutions
will come to us and say, “How
can you help us do what you are
doing?” But the proof is in the
pudding. Our students will be the
best evidence of our successes.
They will be leaders, entrepre-neurs,
innovators, protectors,
inventors, and inclusive moral
agents making a difference in the
world. ■ Annette Holba
IN THE LAST YEAR
I’ve heard many things
about clusters. Across
campus there have been
public discussions and private
conversations. I’ve heard that
clusters involve just research, or
they are limited to industry, or
they are simply just another fad in
higher education these days.
There are research clusters at
top research institutions where
various disciplines come together
and conduct research to find
solutions to problems or to invent
new things. However, I wasn’t
sure what clusters would mean
to Plymouth State since our tra-dition
has focused primarily on
teaching and service to the com-munity.
Not only have clusters
come to organize academic affairs
at PSU but also our institution is
being reorganized in an integra-tive
fashion across departments.
At this point, I know that we’re
evolving as an organization and
we’re embarking on something
very different from practices at
other institutions. This is no fad.
A guiding force
Institutions that have research
clusters are still organized
within and by a traditional
academic framework that has
been colloquially described
as academic silos that tend to
isolate rather than integrate.
This is where we are different.
Integrated clusters are now the
guiding force for Plymouth State
University. We define a cluster as
an organizational unit comprised
of faculty, staff, and students
who come together to engage in
Re-imagining a University Education
In a few years, other institutions will
come to us and say, “How can you help
us do what you are doing?”

when it came to what she wanted
in a college. Coming from the
small town of Brandon, VT, she
knew she wanted a place that was
“like home, but not home.” Eight
college applications and five cam-pus
tours later, she found what she
was looking for at Plymouth State.
When she first visited Plym-outh
State in the fall of 2015,
she came to visit friends from
high school who were enrolled
here. “They showed me around
their dorm rooms, the academic
buildings, and some of the class-rooms,”
recalls Danielle. “I really
liked the laid-back atmosphere at
Plymouth State. It made me feel
comfortable. The campus itself
was so welcoming.”
Danielle came back for an
official campus tour where she
learned more about the Plymouth
State experience, academics, and
checked out the rest of campus.
She knew this is where she
wanted to be.
But as sure as she was that
Plymouth State was the right fit,
Danielle was not immune to the

sitting together at a table and
went over and sat with them.” She
quickly became friends with fel-low
first-year students Jaimie and
Daria, and the three have been
inseparable ever since, whether
they’re skating at Hanaway Rink,
shopping on Main Street, or just
hanging out playing board games
in Mary Lyon Hall.
With her first semester of
college under way and two great
new friends, Danielle is starting
to truly feel at home at PSU. “I’m
really liking it here. I have a rou-tine
with my classes, lunch and
dinner with my friends, studying,
and then a little down time in the
evenings. I’m in a good place.”
Now that she feels she’s got her
feet under her, Danielle is excited to
make her mark on campus through
intramural sports, the Student
Activities Office, and especially the
Community Service Center. “In
high school I received a citizenship
award,” she says. “It is who I am and
want to continue to be. I want to be
a part of what’s going on, be a voice
for my fellow students, and give
feedback. I also want to get to know
the Plymouth community. I hope
I can make a positive impact on a
few people and be remembered for
making a difference.”
Without a doubt Danielle is
well on her way to living up to the
Plymouth State motto Ut prosim
(That I may serve), and will defi-nitely
be one to watch as the Class
of 2020 progresses through the
years. But for now, this first-year
student is making herself at home
at Plymouth State University.

STUDENT SPOTLIGHT
Q&amp;A :
KENDAL LARIVIERE ’17
DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WANTED TO PLAY FIELD
HOCKEY WHEN YOU CAME TO PSU?
No. This is my 10th season playing field hockey,
and I played throughout high school, but I didn’t
plan on playing in college. But that all changed
when I came to Accepted Students Day at PSU
and met with Coach [Bonnie] Lord. The way she
talked about the Plymouth State field hockey
program really spoke to me. She talked about how,
besides being a very successful team, they were a
family, too. That was what I wanted and needed in
a team, even more than winning games.
WHAT DO YOU ENJOY ABOUT BEING A
STUDENT-ATHLETE?
It immediately gets you involved on campus.
You’re part of a team. It can be hard leaving home,
being on your own for the first time, and entering
a school where you might not know anybody.
Being a student-athlete makes that process easier.
You immediately step on the field or go into the
locker room on the first day of meetings, and you
know people and have a support group to turn
to. I love just being able to be with my team—my
family—every day.
RIGHT BEFORE YOU GO ONTO THE FIELD, WHAT DOES
COACH SAY TO MOTIVATE YOU?
Before we go on the field, before every game,
Coach says the same thing: “Play hard, play fair,
play to win, but most of all, play together.” Those
words have come to mean so much for me. We
all need each other on the field, and we play our
best when we’re working as a unit. There’s plenty
of talent on the team, but when we’re all playing as
talented individuals, it never comes together. It’s
always about togetherness and it’s always about us.
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THE TEAM
HAS FACED?
The biggest challenge we’ve probably faced in the
last couple of years is not being able to practice or
play home games on campus.
For my first two years of field hockey, I was
fortunate to be able to practice and play on Arold
Field, here on campus. The downside was that
it was grass. For the past two years, we’ve had to
practice and play off campus, but that’s given us
access to turf fields. Field hockey is a completely
different game on turf than it is on grass. We’re
a better team on turf, but we do miss being on
campus because we’d get some great crowds.
My hope for the team going forward is that they
get the best of both worlds: a turf field right here
on campus with great crowds to cheer them on!
YOU’RE A SENIOR, GRADUATING IN MAY. WHEN YOU
THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE, WHAT DO YOU HOPE
TO GIVE BACK TO PLYMOUTH STATE?
I hope to give the same thing that Plymouth State
field hockey alumni have given to me: support,
encouragement, and reminders to hold onto
every moment.
My coach is very involved with her alumni
and on game days, we get Facebook messages,
e-mails, and texts from field hockey alumni from
over the decades.
Before this season started, Coach shared an
e-mail specifically addressed to the seniors, from
an alumna sharing memories from her senior sea-son
and encouraging us to remember all of those
last moments we’re going to have as the PSU field
hockey team. ■
Kendal Lariviere ’17 has been playing field hockey since she was 12 years old. She loves the game so much
that she’s kept every stick she has ever played with. Her oldest, the one she’s had since her senior year of
high school, is the only one she’s ever given a name: Lolita.
Lauren Lavigne ’94, ’96G, assistant director of athletics for enrollment management and advancement,
recently talked with the senior English major about PSU field hockey and all that it has given to her.

FOR PLYMOUTH STATE ALUMNI, THEIR COLLEGE YEARS WERE THE BEST YEARS OF THEIR LIVES
IN SO MANY WAYS: the first taste of independence; the lifelong friendships forged in the res halls, on the field, or in
the dining hall; the all-night study sessions, concerts, and sporting events.
During their college years, one special person made the difference. A mentor who believed in them, who opened their eyes
to new ideas and perspectives, set them on a path to a great career, and whose impact on them is still appreciated years later.
Alumni and students share with Plymouth Magazine memories of their most beloved mentors, all of whom have served
Plymouth State for decades and have recently chosen to retire.
Not only was I impressed with his memory,
but I was also touched. It demonstrated why
Dr. Chong is fondly remembered by so many.
—Rick Hubbard ’73
A great source of inspiration
Professor Chong was one of those professors
who I will always remember. He really made
a difference in my life. More than 30 years
later, I still remember him taking the time
to get to know me as a person, and we spent
many hours in his classroom and in the coffee
shop discussing the world, career ideas, and
different paths and different cultures. He lit a
fire inside of me and helped me create a future
that has served me well.
When I switched careers many years later to
go into education, we were soon talking again,
discussing my new career. He is, and always
has been, a great source of inspiration for
me. I wish him the best in his well-deserved
retirement. —Carol Sussman-Ghatak ’81
A Sentimental Journey PSU alumni share memories of mentors who are retiring this year
Peng-Khuan Chong
Professor of Political Science
50 years of teaching at Plymouth State
Consummate instructor, educational
role model
I was fortunate to have Dr. Chong for multiple
political science and government courses. He
inspired me to challenge myself academically. I
went on from Plymouth to work for the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and attend law school. I
attribute my motivation to attend law school in
part to the courses I took with Dr. Chong.
47 years after we met, I came back onto
campus as a faculty member teaching a course
in the Criminal Justice Department and
stopped by Dr. Chong’s office. As we were
talking, he suddenly stopped and said to me
“What is your name again?” I replied, “Rick
Hubbard.” He then exclaimed: “I remember
you! You were a good student and a great
soccer player.”

Michael Fischler
Professor of Education
46 years of teaching at Plymouth State
Made class fun
In the fall of my senior year at PSC I was lucky
enough to have a young, new professor, Mike
Fischler, for one of my education classes.
Although his class was at 8 a.m., I don’t think
any of us ever missed it! Dr. Fischler made
class fun with his guitar and great teaching
methods. It was great to grow with him over
the course of that year. I was also lucky enough
to babysit for him and his wife Reine and get to
know their family. Although I graduated many
years ago, I have always kept in touch with
Mike. He has remained supportive of my fam-ily
and me over the years. Congrats to Mike
on his retirement! I hope he loved his years at
Plymouth State as much as I loved mine.
—Lee Richman Nelson ’72
Life-changing teaching and mentoring
I had the great fortune of crossing paths with
Michael Fischler early in my graduate edu-cation.
He has been a source of wisdom and
support for me for two decades. His teaching
and long-term mentoring have been nothing
short of life-changing.
A part of me is saddened to realize that
Plymouth State students will soon no longer be
as able to interact with and learn from Mike,
but I find his interest in exploring a new life
stage apropos. As the Tao Te Ching, one of the
many catalytic works Mike introduced me to,
instructs: “The world belongs to those who let
go.” —Matthew Curtis ’00G
John P. Clark ’71, ’73G
Founding manager of ALLWell North;
longtime athletic director
43 years of serving Plymouth State
Lifelong friend and mentor
I have been very fortunate to have a lifelong
friend and mentor in John P. Clark. From my
early days as a college freshman at Plymouth
State, John has been a trusted leader that I
have leaned on for guidance with every day
and lifelong decisions.
A simple phone call with John, saying
“hello buddy” has created a lifelong bond
that will always be cherished. And when you
meet John in person, he welcomes you with
his infectious warm smile and a handshake or
hug. I have been lucky, like so many others, to
have John as a trusted friend and mentor.
—Paul Hogan ’85
Guidance with humor and wisdom
I was lost my first year at Plymouth. I had no
plan or idea where I was going. I struggled my
first three semesters ending up on academic
probation. I loved Plymouth State—physical
education, my friends, and the work with student
activities—and I was determined not to fail.
John gave me what I needed most, a hand
on my back supporting me. He asked me the
right questions, and guided me in the right
direction with humor and wisdom. Thanks to
him, I learned how to lead, organize, and make
things happen.
That was a long time ago but to this day
John P. Clark is my mentor and the person who
set my life on course. I am grateful for the time
I spent in John’s office. For me John is Plymouth
State University.—Sheila Harding ’80
Gene Fahey
Former men’s basketball coach and senior
associate director of Admissions
41 years of serving Plymouth State
A source of positivity and support
During my time at Plymouth, each morning
consisted of walking into the Admissions
Office for work and being greeted with a joyous
welcome from the front office. It never mat-tered
how busy the day was, Gene Fahey had a
genuine ability to create space for you. He was
enthusiastically invested in the lives of others.
Despite all he had going on, I always felt seen
by Gene; he had a knack for paying attention,
asking thoughtful questions, and listening to
those he cared about. He was an incredible
source of positivity and support in my time as a
student employee in the Admissions Office and
as a member of the PSU community. Gene was
the first to give generously to the fundraisers
my peers and I were running on campus, as
well as the one who kept track of our progress.
When I think of the values that the Plymouth
community embodies I think of Gene. He is
woven into the fabric. With a deep love for
people, Gene’s compass points true north. His
many years of dedicated service are felt and
continue to ripple outward.—Bryan Funk ’11
Soft-spoken and impactful
At a time when I may not have been meeting
my full athletic potential, Coach Fahey
once suggested to me that I was performing
“within” myself. Knowing Gene, I realized this
message might only be the envelope, and the
real content was enclosed. Leave it to Gene
Michael Fischler Gene Fahey
John Clark

to wrap a kick in the pants in what might be
considered a compliment, and to deliver the
message in a way that required thought and
investment to derive the desired result. Also,
leave it to Gene to provide words, albeit deliv-ered
in his usual soft spoken manner, that were
impactful to the point that I have remembered
them periodically over the last 35 years. Know-ing
Gene Fahey as a leader, a colleague, and as
a friend has been and remains an honor and a
privilege. Thank you Gene and best of luck in
your retirement! —Darryll White ’82
the strength to push students past what they
thought they would be and making them better
than what they ever thought they could be.
—Tricia Twomey ’08
Most influential role model
Dr. McCormack was my most influential
professor at Plymouth State. Her intelligence,
kindness, and passion for our chosen field
made me proud to be a physical educator,
and to demand equality and respect for the
important work that we do. She continued
to work tirelessly with people of all ages in
making physical education an integral part of
every child’s education. When I’m asked about
my life’s most influential role model, I say “Dr.
McCormack. She’s the reason I present myself
as an education professional, and she’s the
reason I understand the importance in giving
my all every day.”
Thank you for preparing me for the most
rewarding job in the world, which has filled
my life with daily joy for the past 26 years.
—Mary O’Sullivan ’82
Warren Mason
Professor of Business and
Communication Studies
34 years of teaching at Plymouth State
A touchstone for his students
I had two classes with Warren, Organizational
Communications—which was phenomenal—
and Intro to Public Relations, which I signed
up for because he was such a great instructor.
But it wasn’t until after I started my career
that I truly developed an appreciation for his
teaching. I realized that everything he taught
me was exactly what I needed to know for
working as a PR professional in the real world.
I was able to take what he taught me and carry
it with me as a guide.
Since then, he has been instrumental in my
career. He’s been encouraging, someone I can
talk shop with—he’s been a touchstone for me
all these years, and I hope he knows that. I’ve
never had a professor like him before.
—Amanda Bacon ’04
The man, the myth, the legend
I first became aware of the man, the myth, the
legend of Warren Mason during my first year
Top to bottom: Mark Okrant, Louise McCormack,
and Warren Mason
Mark Okrant
Professor Emeritus of Tourism Management
37 years of teaching at Plymouth State
Supportive and encouraging
Dr. O … made me want to be the best student
possible, not just in the classroom but outside
the classroom. One of the memories that
will always stick with me is the night of the
Evening of Connections dinner last October. I
was the student speaker and after my speech,
Dr. O came up to me and said that he was very
proud of me. It felt great to make my advisor
proud! —Anna Brown ’16
Quick wit and committed teacher
At the end of my freshman year at PSU I still
had not declared a major, so I went through
the entire course catalog and selected a hand-ful
of majors I thought might be appropriate
for me. I decided to talk to a few advisors
regarding those degree paths, and Mark
Okrant was the first and only advisor I ended
up speaking to. It was evident from our first
conversation how much he cared about his
students and wanted to see them succeed.
His quick wit and kind sense of humor were
always appreciated. —Sean McGlynn ’15
Louise Samaha
McCormack ’72
Professor of Health and Human Performance
36 years of teaching at Plymouth State
Making students better than they ever
thought they could be
It’s challenging to put into words what Dr.
McCormack means to me. She was my pro-fessor
and advisor, but most of all she was and
remains my role model. She inspired all of
her students, including myself, to be the best
professionals, advocates, and human beings
they can be. Dr. McCormack has taught me to
constantly strive for perfection and to never
stop learning. With every failure and success
I experience, I always reflect on how to do it
better—how to be better. I hope 40 years from
now I can say that I inspired one person the
way she has inspired so many of us.
Thank you Dr. McCormack, for having
16 Plymouth Magazine | Fall 2016
at Plymouth. As a tutor in the Writing Center
during my time at PSU, many students came
in for assistance for his marketing communi-cations
course. When I enrolled in his writing
course (and the subsequent public relations
course) I found out first-hand that he held his
students to a high standard of work.
Warren gave me the opportunity to help
teach a section of his Introduction to the
Academic Community. This first experience
of being a teaching assistant started me on a
path for future graduate school programs in
marketing and communications with teaching
opportunities at Syracuse, Indiana, and Emory
Universities. It’s probably no surprise that
today I’m a marketing professor, and he played
a consequential part of that.
Many thanks for making my Plymouth
experience so profound, Warren.
—Anthony Koschmann ’02
Stacey Yap
Professor of Anthropology-Sociology
28 years of teaching at Plymouth State
Warm, welcoming, and unforgettable
Stacey Yap is one of those unforgettable
people who moves into your life and her story
completely changes your perspective from that
point forward. I met Stacey in my first week as
a PSU student. I hadn’t declared a major and
she had been assigned as my advisor. She was
immediately warm and welcoming, asking me
about my interests while she shared her own
passions throughout our discussion. I’d learn a
little more about her in each advising session:
her daughter the dancer and hospitality
professional; her corporate career in consumer
research; her love of the nearby garden oasis—
every time I left her office I would have some
new and interesting topic to investigate. Her
desire to learn more was just contagious!
Thank you Stacey, you truly are an inspira-tion
for all of us! —Ava Tyler ’14
Passionate and inspirational
When I first met Professor Yap I realized she
was a very special person. Her passion for the
subjects she taught are what inspired me to
continue to sign up for many of the courses
she taught. In her classroom, I was able to
visualize the issues and conflicts she discussed
in class, which inspired me to dig deeper.
Professor Yap understands and connects
with people, which allowed me learn and
develop new perspectives on issues that I
would have never imagined myself contem-plating
before. Her love for people served as
her platform to teach and bring awareness to
social inequality, racial discrimination, and
women’s issues around the world. It’s hard to
believe that she never envisioned teaching
would be her career, but I feel blessed knowing
she was able to teach and inspire students like
me to care about people around the world.
Stacey Yap has made my education experience
at PSU a very special one. —Zach Ziemba ’17
Bryon Middlekauff
Professor Emeritus of Geography and
Environmental Planning
27 years of teaching at Plymouth State
A gifted educator and a good friend
I met Bryon in spring of 2001 when I took my
first geography class called Physical Environ-ment.
At the time I was a meteorology major;
after only a few weeks I quickly realized I was
in the wrong major. Bryon taught with such
passion and enthusiasm that it made me con-fident
in my decision to become a geography
major with a focus on terrain analysis. Bryon
became my advisor as well as a mentor and
friend to me over the last few years of college.
Bryon encouraged me to pursue graduate
school and we remained in touch after I
graduated. During my graduate program at
Plymouth State, he was a mentor for my thesis
project, and provided me with encouragement
and guidance during that difficult process. I
remain in touch with Bryon today and consider
him a good friend. I will miss him; the Plymouth
State Geography Department won’t be the
same without him! —Linda Burbank ’04
A man of great wisdom and a lifelong mentor
I remember the first time I met Bryon Mid-dlekauff.
It was in Environmental Geography,
one of the first physical geography courses
I took at PSU. He pulled out his old-school
overhead projector and had these surprisingly
well-drawn diagrams of geological features
and processes. His face lit up as he began his
lecture. You wouldn’t think overhead projector

slides would be so exciting, but he knew how
to turn any physical geography topic into an
exciting one! I always found his lectures cap-tivating
and inspiring and thought to myself,
“Now there’s a guy who loves his job!”
He was dedicated to his students and to
making higher education a worthwhile experi-ence.
He became a lifelong mentor to many of
his former students, including me. To this day,
I sometimes find myself asking him for advice.

If you’re a proud Plymouth State Panther, you have Dick
Chandler and his classmates in the Class of 1963 to thank.
While other mascots were being proposed and considered
back in 1959—including the Plymouth Stallions!—it was the
Plymouth Teachers College Class of 1963 who suggested
the Plymouth Panthers. The rest, as they say, is history.
Dick and his classmates have given Plymouth State much
more than its legendary mascot, though. On the occasion
of their 50th reunion in 2013, they established the
Plymouth Teachers College Class of 1963 Panther
Scholarship in Education. Dick, George Davis (for whom the
George E. Davis ’63 Track in ALLWell North was named),
Charles Hunnewell, and Malcolm Murray were founding
donors. Each year, the scholarship is given to an outstand-ing
education major from New Hampshire who is in need
of assistance.
Recently, Dick, who followed up his Panther basketball glory days with a long and distin-guished
career in physical education as a teacher and athletic director, upped his game with
a generous bequest intention to the Panther Scholarship. “Plymouth gave me so much
while I was a student here that I wanted to do something for the University, and for the
students. I hope my gift will inspire others to do the same.”—Dick Chandler

exposure to the classroom during my
first semester through student teach-ing,
I developed a spectrum of transfer-rable
skills including public speaking,
organization, project management, and
more. Over the past 20 years my career
has meandered in different aspects of
education, from working in the class-room
with middle school students and
community college students to more
than a decade of residential education

μShawn O’Brien ’86
Promoted to
Brigadier General
Congratulations to Shawn O’Brien ’86,
who was recently promoted to brig-adier
general in the New Hampshire
Army National Guard. He will be
serving as director of the Joint Staff,
preparing senior staff members to
execute domestic operations.
“The opportunity to serve at this
level is a very humbling experience,”
O’Brien says. “The young generation
of service members that I work with
drives me to become the best leader I can be and set an example of being a
military professional.”
O’Brien carries with him years of service and experience. He was deployed
for 15 months in Afghanistan from March 2005 to June 2006. In June 2010,
he earned a Master’s degree in Strategic Studies from the Army War College.
While at PSU, O’Brien majored in exercise physiology, with a minor in polit-ical
science. One of O’Brien’s biggest influences at Plymouth was Dr. Thomas
Schlesinger, a professor of political science and WWII US Army veteran, who
made a lasting impression on O’Brien and his decision to join the military.
“Dr. S shared numerous stories with our class,” recalls O’Brien. “I respect-ed
that this man didn’t just talk about history, he was involved in historical
events.”
O’Brien still looks back fondly on his days at Plymouth State, and his frater-nity
Alpha Theta, which consisted of several Army Reservists. He credits his
four years at Plymouth State as the foundation for a successful career as a US
Army infantry officer.
“I believe motivation is a fire from within,” O’Brien says. “If someone else
tries to light that fire under you, chances are it will burn out quickly. I was
very fortunate to have been influenced by professors, staff, and other students
at Plymouth. Thirty years later the motivation and fire burns strong.”
In addition to his new position, O’Brien is also a full-time account manager
with Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. He lives in Fremont, NH, with
his wife Kimberley Steadman O’Brien ’88. They have two daughters, Heather
and Kelly, who are both away at college studying journalism.
Thank you, Brigadier General O’Brien. PSU salutes you! ■ Emmett Warren ’16
Michael Goldenberg ’84, athletic
trainer at the Lawrenceville School in
Lawrenceville, NJ, was welcomed into
the National Athletic Trainers’ Associa-tion’s
Hall of Fame during the National
Athletic Training Convention, held in
Baltimore in early August. Induction
into the hall of fame, the association’s
highest honor, recognizes athletic
trainers who exemplify the mission of
NATA and advance the profession.

and more. The skills and lessons I
learned at Plymouth State contributed
in some way with every new chapter of
my career.”

wellness and support program. In
addition, she is in her second year
of service as president of the Maine
Breast Cancer Coalition and is Maine’s
field coordinator/team leader for the
National Breast Cancer Coalition.
She writes, “My degree in marketing
created a foundation for the work that
I currently do in public relations. I
love that my current positions enable
Kristie Ruppe ’96
me to help educate people on health
and wellness and provide them with
the support that they need to make
improvements in their lives. I also
love that I get to learn right along with
the people that I serve. As I discover
health issues that are important to our
local communities, I get to provide
them with resources and educational
opportunities and programming that
will positively impact the wellness of
our community members!”

director of Compas de Nicaragua
(Friends of Nicaragua, photo below).

Academy, served as director of
the PSU Chamber Singers in spring
2013 and has sung with the New Hamp-shire
Master Chorale since 2008.
μLaurel (Kupillas) Ostiguy ’97 recently published her first novel,
Last Goodbye, which draws upon her experiences at PSU. She says, “When
I wrote about the fictitious campus, I envisioned Plymouth and the entire
town. I even used some names of places and locations that I visited when
I was a student in New Hampshire, and some of the characters are named
for friends from college. More importantly, the split wall in the dorm
room was an homage to my room in Smith Hall—best room ever! I lived
in it for two years with my roommate Melissa. Even though I work in
finance in Boston, my dream has always been to publish a book and now
thanks to those interested in the book, I am in the process of writing a
spin-off to Last Goodbye. I’m so excited to begin this new journey in my
life as a published author!”

24 Plymouth Magazine | Fall 2016
Touching All Bases
The top spot in the heart of Carleton Parish ’71 goes unequivocally to his late wife Sharon.
After her firm hold on the position, two passions run neck and neck: baseball and Plymouth
State University. “PSU gave me the polish I didn’t have. My professors completed me as a
gentleman,” says Parish, a retired United States Marshal. “The University is where I learned for
the first time in my life.”
In close contention for his affections with PSU are the Red Sox. He gets to indulge both
passions—the game and the University—during spring training at Fort Myers, where he lives and
both the Sox and Panthers train. “Some of PSU’s players can’t afford to go to Fort Myers. But if
you’re a team, you need to be a team,” says Parish, explaining why he supports the Panthers’
annual training trip to Florida.
Parish’s philanthropy goes well beyond the diamonds. He has made a sizeable bequest to PSU—
“You never see a U-Haul at a funeral procession,” he jokes—created two endowed scholarships;
made a major capital gift to the ALLWell North building, contributed to the Fund for Plymouth
State; and supported numerous projects and students in need. “Like my beloved wife of 36
years,” he says, “I want to pay it forward.” ■ Orna Feldman
